<p class="first">It is undoubtedly a surprising fact that down to the
present time no history of Sanskrit literature as a whole has been
written in English. For not only does that literature possess much
intrinsic merit, but the light it sheds on the life and thought of the
population of our Indian Empire ought to have a peculiar interest for
the British nation. Owing chiefly to the lack of an adequate account of
the subject, few, even of the young men who leave these shores every
year to be its future rulers, possess any connected information about
the literature in which the civilisation of Modern India can be traced
to its sources, and without which that civilisation cannot be fully
understood. It was, therefore, with the greatest pleasure that I
accepted Mr. Gosse&rsquo;s invitation to contribute a volume to this
series of <i>Literatures of the World</i>; for this appeared to me to
be a peculiarly good opportunity for diffusing information on a subject
in which more than twenty years of continuous study and teaching had
instilled into me an ever-deepening interest.</p>
<p>Professor Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s valuable <i>History of Ancient
Sanskrit Literature</i> is limited in its scope to the Vedic period. It
has long been out of print; and Vedic research has necessarily made
great strides in the forty years which have elapsed since its
publication.</p>
<p>The only book accessible to the English reader on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e164" href="#xd21e164" name=
"xd21e164">vi</a>]</span>the history of Sanskrit literature in general
has hitherto been the translation of Professor Weber&rsquo;s
<i>Academical Lectures on Indian Literature</i>, as delivered nearly
half a century ago at Berlin. The numerous and often very lengthy notes
in this work supply the results of research during the next twenty-five
years; but as these notes often modify, or even cancel, the statements
of the unaltered original text of 1852, the result is bewildering to
the student. Much new light has been thrown on various branches of
Sanskrit literature since 1878, when the last notes were added to this
translation, which, moreover, is not in any way adapted to the wants of
the general reader. The only work on the subject appealing to the
latter is the late Sir M. Monier-Williams&rsquo;s <i>Indian Wisdom</i>.
That book, however, although it furnishes, in addition to the
translated specimens, some account of the chief departments of Sanskrit
literature, is not a history. There is thus distinctly a twofold demand
in this country for a history of Sanskrit literature. The student is in
want of a guide setting forth in a clear and trustworthy manner the
results of research down to the present time, and the cultivated
English reader looks for a book presenting in an intelligible and
attractive form information which must have a special interest to us
owing to our close relations with India.</p>
<p>To lack of space, no less than to the scope of the present series,
is due the exclusion of a full account of the technical literature of
law, science, and art, which contains much that would interest even the
general reader; but the brief epitome given in the Appendix will, I
hope, suffice to direct the student to all the most important
authorities.</p>
<p>As to the bibliographical notes, I trust that, though <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e176" href="#xd21e176" name=
"xd21e176">vii</a>]</span>necessarily restricted in extent, they will
enable the student to find all further information he may want on
matters of detail; for instance, the evidence for approximate dates,
which had occasionally to be summarily stated even in the text.</p>
<p>In writing this history of Sanskrit literature, I have dwelt more on
the life and thought of Ancient India, which that literature embodies,
than would perhaps have appeared necessary in the case of a European
literature. This I have done partly because Sanskrit literature, as
representing an independent civilisation entirely different from that
of the West, requires more explanation than most others; and partly
because, owing to the remarkable continuity of Indian culture, the
religious and social institutions of Modern India are constantly
illustrated by those of the past.</p>
<p>Besides the above-mentioned works of Professors Max M&uuml;ller and
Weber, I have made considerable use of Professor L. von
Schroeder&rsquo;s excellent <i lang="de">Indiens Literatur und
Cultur</i> (1887). I have further consulted in one way or another
nearly all the books and monographs mentioned in the bibliographical
notes. Much of what I have written is also based on my own studies of
Sanskrit literature.</p>
<p>All the quotations which I have given by way of illustration I have
myself carefully selected from the original works. Excepting the short
extracts on page 333 from Cowell and Thomas&rsquo;s excellent
translation of the <i>Harshacharita</i>, all the renderings of these
are my own. In my versions of Rigvedic stanzas I have, however,
occasionally borrowed a line or phrase from Griffith. Nearly all my
renderings are as close as the use of metre permits. I have endeavoured
to reproduce, as far as possible, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e190" href="#xd21e190" name="xd21e190">viii</a>]</span>measures of
the original, except in the quotations from the dramas, where I have
always employed blank verse. I have throughout refrained from rhyme, as
misrepresenting the original Sanskrit.</p>
<p>In the transliteration of Sanskrit words I have been guided by the
desire to avoid the use of letters which might mislead those who do not
know Sanskrit. I have therefore departed in a few particulars from the
system on which Sanskrit scholars are now almost unanimously agreed,
and which I otherwise follow myself. Hence for <i>c</i> and <i>ch</i> I
have written <i>ch</i> and <i>chh</i> respectively, though in the rare
cases where these two appear in combination I have retained <i>cch</i>
(instead of <i>chchh</i>). I further use <i>sh</i> for the lingual
<i>&#7779;</i>, and <i>&ccedil;</i> for the palatal <i>&#347;</i>, and
<i>&#7771;i</i> for the vowel <i>&#7771;</i>. I have not thought it
necessary to distinguish the guttural <i>n&#775;</i> and the palatal
<i>&ntilde;</i> by diacritical marks, simply printing, for instance,
<i>anga</i> and <i>pancha</i>. The reader who is unacquainted with
Sanskrit will thus pronounce all words correctly by simply treating all
the consonants as in English; remembering only that the vowels should
be sounded as in Italian, and that <i>e</i> and <i>o</i> are always
long.</p>
<p>I am indebted for some suggestions to my friend Mr. F. C. S.
Schiller, Fellow and Tutor of Corpus Christi College, who looked
through the final proof of the chapter on Philosophy. To my pupil Mr.
A. B. Keith, Boden Sanskrit scholar and Classical scholar of Balliol,
who has read all the final proofs with great care, I owe not only the
removal of a number of errors of the press, but also several valuable
criticisms regarding matters of fact.</p>

<h2 class="super">A History of<br>
Sanskrit Literature</h2>
<h2 class="label">Chapter I</h2>
<h2 class="main">Introductory</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Since the Renaissance there has been no event of such
world-wide significance in the history of culture as the discovery of
Sanskrit literature in the latter part of the eighteenth century. After
Alexander&rsquo;s invasion, the Greeks became to some extent acquainted
with the learning of the Indians; the Arabs, in the Middle Ages,
introduced the knowledge of Indian science to the West; a few European
missionaries, from the sixteenth century onwards, were not only aware
of the existence of, but also acquired some familiarity with, the
ancient language of India; and Abraham Roger even translated the
Sanskrit poet Bhart&#7771;ihari into Dutch as early as 1651.
Nevertheless, till about a hundred and twenty years ago there was no
authentic information in Europe about the existence of Sanskrit
literature, but only vague surmise, finding expression in stories about
the wisdom of the Indians. The enthusiasm with which Voltaire in his
<i lang="fr">Essai sur les M&oelig;urs et l&rsquo;Esprit des
Nations</i> greeted the lore of the <i>Ezour Vedam</i>, a work
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=
"pb2">2</a>]</span>brought from India and introduced to his notice in
the middle of the last century, was premature. For this work was later
proved to be a forgery made in the seventeenth century by a Jesuit
missionary. The scepticism justified by this fabrication, and indulged
in when the discovery of the genuine Sanskrit literature was announced,
survived far into the present century. Thus, Dugald Stewart, the
philosopher, wrote an essay in which he endeavoured to prove that not
only Sanskrit literature, but also the Sanskrit language, was a forgery
made by the crafty Brahmans on the model of Greek after
Alexander&rsquo;s conquest. Indeed, this view was elaborately defended
by a professor at Dublin as late as the year 1838.</p>
<p>The first impulse to the study of Sanskrit was given by the
practical administrative needs of our Indian possessions. Warren
Hastings, at that time Governor-General, clearly seeing the advantage
of ruling the Hindus as far as possible according to their own laws and
customs, caused a number of Brahmans to prepare a digest based on the
best ancient Indian legal authorities. An English version of this
Sanskrit compilation, made through the medium of a Persian translation,
was published in 1776. The introduction to this work, besides giving
specimens of the Sanskrit script, for the first time supplied some
trustworthy information about the ancient Indian language and
literature. The earliest step, however, towards making Europe
acquainted with actual Sanskrit writings was taken by Charles Wilkins,
who, having, at the instigation of Warren Hastings, acquired a
considerable knowledge of Sanskrit at Benares, published in 1785 a
translation of the <i>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</i>, or <i>The Song of
the Adorable One</i>, and two years <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3"
href="#pb3" name="pb3">3</a>]</span>later, a version of the well-known
collection of fables entitled <i>Hitopade&ccedil;a</i>, or <i>Friendly
Advice</i>.</p>
<p>Sir <span class="sc">William Jones</span> (1746&ndash;94) was,
however, the pioneer of Sanskrit studies in the West. It was this
brilliant and many-sided Orientalist who, during his too brief career
of eleven years in India, first aroused a keen interest in the study of
Indian antiquity by his unwearied literary activity and by the
foundation of the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1784. Having rapidly
acquired an accurate knowledge of Sanskrit, he published in 1789 a
translation of <i>&Ccedil;akuntal&#257;</i>, the finest Sanskrit drama,
which was greeted with enthusiasm by such judges as Herder and Goethe.
This was followed by a translation of the <i>Code of Manu</i>, the most
important of the Sanskrit law-books. To Sir William Jones also belongs
the credit of having been the first man who ever printed an edition of
a Sanskrit text. This was a short lyrical poem entitled
<i>&#7770;itusam&#803;h&#257;ra</i>, or <i>Cycle of the Seasons</i>,
published in 1792.</p>
<p>We next come to the great name of <span class="sc">Henry Thomas
Colebrooke</span> (1765&ndash;1837), a man of extraordinary industry,
combined with rare clearness of intellect and sobriety of judgment. The
first to handle the Sanskrit language and literature on scientific
principles, he published many texts, translations, and essays dealing
with almost every branch of Sanskrit learning, thus laying the solid
foundations on which later scholars have built.</p>
<p>While Colebrooke was beginning his literary career in India during
the opening years of the century, the romance of war led to the
practical knowledge of Sanskrit being introduced on the Continent of
Europe. <span class="sc">Alexander Hamilton</span> (1765&ndash;1824),
an Englishman who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span>had acquired a good knowledge of Sanskrit in India,
happened to be passing through France on his way home in 1802.
Hostilities breaking out afresh just then, a decree of Napoleon,
directed against all Englishmen in the country, kept Hamilton a
prisoner in Paris. During his long involuntary stay in that city he
taught Sanskrit to some French scholars, and especially to the German
romantic poet <span class="sc">Friedrich Schlegel</span>. One of the
results of these studies was the publication by Schlegel of his work
<i>On the Language and Wisdom of the Indians</i> (1808). This book
produced nothing less than a revolution in the science of language by
the introduction of the comparative and the historical method. It led
to the foundation of the science of comparative philology by
<span class="sc">Franz Bopp</span> in his treatise on the conjugational
system of Sanskrit in comparison with that of Greek, Latin, Persian,
and German (1816). Schlegel&rsquo;s work, moreover, aroused so much
zeal for the study of Sanskrit in Germany, that the vast progress made
since his day in this branch of learning has been mainly due to the
labours of his countrymen.</p>
<p>In the early days of Sanskrit studies Europeans became acquainted
only with that later phase of the ancient language of India which is
familiar to the Pandits, and is commonly called Classical Sanskrit. So
it came about that the literature composed in this dialect engaged the
attention of scholars almost exclusively down to the middle of the
century. Colebrooke had, it is true, supplied as early as 1805 valuable
information about the literature of the older period in his essay <i>On
the Vedas</i>. Nearly a quarter of a century later, <span class="sc">F.
Rosen</span>, a German scholar, had conceived the plan of making this
more ancient literature known to Europe from the rich <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>collection
of manuscripts at the East India House; and his edition of the first
eighth of the <i>Rigveda</i> was actually brought out in 1838, shortly
after his premature death. But it was not till <span class="sc">Rudolf
Roth</span> (1821&ndash;95), the founder of Vedic philology, published
his epoch-making little book <i>On the Literature and History of the
Veda</i> in 1846, that the studies of <span class="corr" id="xd21e533"
title="Source: Sankritists">Sanskritists</span> received a lasting
impulse in the direction of the earlier and more important literature
of the Vedas. These studies have since been prosecuted with such zeal,
that nearly all the most valuable works of the Vedic, as well as the
later period, have within the last fifty years been made accessible in
thoroughly trustworthy editions.</p>
<p>In judging of the magnitude of the work thus accomplished, it should
be borne in mind that the workers have been far fewer in this than in
other analogous fields, while the literature of the Vedas at least
equals in extent what survives of the writings of ancient Greece. Thus
in the course of a century the whole range of Sanskrit literature,
which in quantity exceeds that of Greece and Rome put together, has
been explored. The great bulk of it has been edited, and most of its
valuable productions have been translated, by competent hands. There
has long been at the service of scholars a Sanskrit dictionary, larger
and more scientific than any either of the classical languages yet
possesses. The detailed investigations in every department of Sanskrit
literature are now so numerous, that a comprehensive work embodying the
results of all these researches has become a necessity. An
encyclop&aelig;dia covering the whole domain of Indo-Aryan antiquity
has accordingly been planned on a more extensive scale than that of any
similar undertaking, and is now being published at Strasburg in parts,
contributed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>to by about thirty specialists of various
nationalities. By the tragic death, in April 1898, of its eminent
editor, Professor <span class="sc">B&uuml;hler</span> of Vienna,
Sanskrit scholarship has sustained an irreparable loss. The work begun
by him is being completed by another very distinguished Indianist,
Professor <span class="sc">Kielhorn</span> of G&ouml;ttingen.</p>
<p>Although so much of Sanskrit literature has already been published,
an examination of the catalogues of Sanskrit manuscripts, of which an
enormous number are preserved in European and Indian libraries, proves
that there are still many minor works awaiting, and likely to repay,
the labours of an editor.</p>
<p>The study of Sanskrit literature deserves far more attention than it
has yet received in this country. For in that ancient heritage the
languages, the religious and intellectual life and thought, in short,
the whole civilisation of the Hindus, who form the vast majority of the
inhabitants of our Indian Empire, have their roots. Among all the
ancient literatures, that of India is, moreover, undoubtedly in
intrinsic value and &aelig;sthetic merit second only to that of Greece.
To the latter it is, as a source for the study of human evolution, even
superior. Its earliest period, being much older than any product of
Greek literature, presents a more primitive form of belief, and
therefore gives a clearer picture of the development of religious ideas
than any other literary monument of the world. Hence it came about
that, just as the discovery of the Sanskrit language led to the
foundation of the science of Comparative Philology, an acquaintance
with the literature of the Vedas resulted in the foundation of the
science of Comparative Mythology by <span class="sc">Adalbert
Kuhn</span> and <span class="sc">Max M&uuml;ller</span>.</p>
<p>Though it has touched excellence in most of its <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span>branches,
Sanskrit literature has mainly achieved greatness in religion and
philosophy. The Indians are the only division of the Indo-European
family which has created a great national
religion&mdash;Brahmanism&mdash;and a great
world-religion&mdash;Buddhism; while all the rest, far from displaying
originality in this sphere, have long since adopted a foreign faith.
The intellectual life of the Indians has, in fact, all along been more
dominated by religious thought than that of any other race. The
Indians, moreover, developed independently several systems of
philosophy which bear evidence of high speculative powers. The great
interest, however, which these two subjects must have for us lies, not
so much in the results they attained, as in the fact that every step in
the evolution of religion and philosophy can be traced in Sanskrit
literature.</p>
<p>The importance of ancient Indian literature as a whole largely
consists in its originality. Naturally isolated by its gigantic
mountain barrier in the north, the Indian peninsula has ever since the
Aryan invasion formed a world apart, over which a unique form of Aryan
civilisation rapidly spread, and has ever since prevailed. When the
Greeks, towards the end of the fourth century B.C., invaded the
North-West, the Indians had already fully worked out a national culture
of their own, unaffected by foreign influences. And, in spite of
successive waves of invasion and conquest by Persians, Greeks,
Scythians, Muhammadans, the national development of the life and
literature of the Indo-Aryan race remained practically unchecked and
unmodified from without down to the era of British occupation. No other
branch of the Indo-European stock has experienced an isolated evolution
like this. No other country except <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8"
href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>China can trace back its language
and literature, its religious beliefs and rites, its domestic and
social customs, through an uninterrupted development of more than three
thousand years.</p>
<p>A few examples will serve to illustrate this remarkable continuity
in Indian civilisation. Sanskrit is still spoken as the tongue of the
learned by thousands of Brahmans, as it was centuries before our era.
Nor has it ceased to be used for literary purposes, for many books and
journals written in the ancient language are still produced. The
copying of Sanskrit manuscripts is still continued in hundreds of
libraries in India, uninterrupted even by the introduction of printing
during the present century. The Vedas are still learnt by heart as they
were long before the invasion of Alexander, and could even now be
restored from the lips of religious teachers if every manuscript or
printed copy of them were destroyed. A Vedic stanza of immemorial
antiquity, addressed to the sun-god Savitri, is still recited in the
daily worship of the Hindus. The god Vish&#7751;u, adored more than
3000 years ago, has countless votaries in India at the present day.
Fire is still produced for sacrificial purposes by means of two sticks,
as it was in ages even more remote. The wedding ceremony of the modern
Hindu, to single out but one social custom, is essentially the same as
it was long before the Christian era.</p>
<p>The history of ancient Indian literature naturally falls into two
main periods. The first is the Vedic, which beginning perhaps as early
as 1500 B.C., extends in its latest phase to about 200 B.C. In the
former half of the Vedic age the character of its literature was
creative and poetical, while the centre of culture lay in the territory
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span>of the Indus and its tributaries, the modern
Panj&#257;b; in the latter half, literature was theologically
speculative in matter and prosaic in form, while the centre of
intellectual life had shifted to the valley of the Ganges. Thus in the
course of the Vedic age Aryan civilisation had overspread the whole of
Hindustan Proper, the vast tract extending from the mouths of the Indus
to those of the Ganges, bounded on the north by the Him&#257;laya, and
on the south by the Vindhya range. The second period, concurrent with
the final offshoots of Vedic literature and closing with the Muhammadan
conquest after 1000 A.D., is the Sanskrit period strictly speaking. In
a certain sense, owing to the continued literary use of Sanskrit,
mainly for the composition of commentaries, this period may be regarded
as coming down to the present day. During this second epoch Brahmanic
culture was introduced into and overspread the southern portion of the
continent called the Dekhan or &ldquo;the South.&rdquo; In the course
of these two periods taken together, Indian literature attained
noteworthy results in nearly every department. The Vedic age, which,
unlike the earlier epoch of Greece, produced only religious works,
reached a high standard of merit in lyric poetry, and later made some
advance towards the formation of a prose style.</p>
<p>The Sanskrit period<span class="corr" id="xd21e573" title=
"Not in source">,</span> embracing in general secular subjects,
achieved distinction in many branches of literature, in national as
well as court epic, in lyric and especially didactic poetry, in the
drama, in fairy tales, fables, and romances. Everywhere we find much
true poetry, the beauty of which is, however, marred by obscurity of
style and the ever-increasing taint of artificiality. But this period
produced few works which, regarded as a whole, are dominated by a sense
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>harmony and proportion. Such considerations have
had little influence on the &aelig;sthetic notions of India. The
tendency has been rather towards exaggeration, manifesting itself in
all directions. The almost incredible development of detail in ritual
observance; the extraordinary excesses of asceticism; the grotesque
representations of mythology in art; the frequent employment of vast
numbers in description; the immense bulk of the epics; the unparalleled
conciseness of one of the forms of prose; the huge compounds habitually
employed in the later style, are among the more striking manifestations
of this defect of the Indian mind.</p>
<p>In various branches of scientific literature, in phonetics, grammar,
mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and law, the Indians also achieved
notable results. In some of these subjects their attainments are,
indeed, far in advance of what was accomplished by the Greeks.</p>
<p>History is the one weak spot in Indian literature. It is, in fact,
non-existent. The total lack of the historical sense is so
characteristic, that the whole course of Sanskrit literature is
darkened by the shadow of this defect, suffering as it does from an
entire absence of exact chronology. So true is this, that the very date
of <span class="sc">K&#257;lid&#257;sa</span>, the greatest of Indian
poets, was long a matter of controversy within the limits of a thousand
years, and is even now doubtful to the extent of a century or two. Thus
the dates of Sanskrit authors are in the vast majority of cases only
known approximately, having been inferred from the indirect evidence of
interdependence, quotation or allusion, development of language or
style. As to the events of their lives, we usually know nothing at all,
and only in a few cases one or two general facts. Two causes seem to
have combined to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>bring about this remarkable result. In the first
place, early India wrote no history because it never made any. The
ancient Indians never went through a struggle for life, like the Greeks
in the Persian and the Romans in the Punic wars, such as would have
welded their tribes into a nation and developed political greatness.
Secondly, the Brahmans, whose task it would naturally have been to
record great deeds, had early embraced the doctrine that all action and
existence are a positive evil, and could therefore have felt but little
inclination to chronicle historical events.</p>
<p>Such being the case, definite dates do not begin to appear in Indian
literary history till about 500 A.D. The chronology of the Vedic period
is altogether conjectural, being based entirely on internal evidence.
Three main literary strata can be clearly distinguished in it by
differences in language and style, as well as in religious and social
views. For the development of each of these strata a reasonable length
of time must be allowed; but all we can here hope to do is to
approximate to the truth by centuries. The lower limit of the second
Vedic stratum cannot, however, be fixed later <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e589" title="Source: that">than</span> 500 B.C., because its
latest doctrines are presupposed by Buddhism, and the date of the death
of Buddha has been with a high degree of probability calculated, from
the recorded dates of the various Buddhist councils, to be 480 B.C.
With regard to the commencement of the Vedic age, there seems to have
been a decided tendency among Sanskrit scholars to place it too high.
2000 B.C. is commonly represented as its starting-point. Supposing this
to be correct, the truly vast period of 1500 years is required to
account for a development of language and thought hardly greater than
that between the Homeric <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href=
"#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>and the Attic age of Greece.
Professor Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s earlier estimate of 1200 B.C., formed
forty years ago, appears to be much nearer the mark. A lapse of three
centuries, say from 1300&ndash;1000 B.C., would amply account for the
difference between what is oldest and newest in Vedic hymn poetry.
Considering that the affinity of the oldest form of the Avestan
language with the dialect of the Vedas is already so great that, by the
mere application of phonetic laws, whole Avestan stanzas may be
translated word for word into Vedic, so as to produce verses correct
not only in form but in poetic spirit; considering further, that if we
knew the Avestan language at as early a stage as we know the Vedic, the
former would necessarily be almost identical with the latter, it is
impossible to avoid the conclusion that the Indian branch must have
separated from the Iranian only a very short time before the beginnings
of Vedic literature, and can therefore have hardly entered the
North-West of India even as early as 1500 B.C. All previous estimates
of the antiquity of the Vedic period have been outdone by the recent
theory of Professor Jacobi of Bonn, who supposes that period goes back
to at least 4000 B.C. This theory is based on astronomical calculations
connected with a change in the beginning of the seasons, which
Professor Jacobi thinks has taken place since the time of the
<i>Rigveda</i>. The whole estimate is, however, invalidated by the
assumption of a doubtful, and even improbable, meaning in a Vedic word,
which forms the very starting-point of the theory. Meanwhile we must
rest content with the certainty that Vedic literature in any case is of
considerably higher antiquity than that of Greece.</p>
<p>For the post-Vedic period we have, in addition to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>results
of internal evidence, a few landmarks of general chronological
importance in the visits of foreigners. The earliest date of this kind
is that of the invasion of India by Alexander in 326 B.C. This was
followed by the sojourn in India of various Greeks, of whom the most
notable was <span class="sc">Megasthenes</span>. He resided for some
years about 300 B.C. at the court of P&#257;&#7789;aliputra (the modern
Patna), and has left a valuable though fragmentary account of the
contemporary state of Indian society. Many centuries later India was
visited by three Chinese Buddhist pilgrims, <span class="sc">Fa
Hian</span> (399 A.D.), <span class="sc">Hiouen Thsang</span>
(630&ndash;645), and <span class="sc">I Tsing</span> (671&ndash;695).
The records of their travels, which have been preserved, and are all
now translated into English, shed much light on the social conditions,
the religious thought, and the Buddhist antiquities of India in their
day. Some general and specific facts about Indian literature also can
be gathered from them. Hiouen Thsang especially supplies some important
statements about contemporary Sanskrit poets. It is not till his time
that we can say of any Sanskrit writer that he was alive in any
particular year, excepting only the three Indian astronomers, whose
exact dates in the fifth and sixth centuries have been recorded by
themselves. It was only the information supplied by the two earlier
Chinese writers that made possible the greatest arch&aelig;ological
discovery of the present century in India, that of the site of
Buddha&rsquo;s birthplace, Kapila-vastu, identified in December 1896.
At the close of our period we have the very valuable account of the
country at the time of the Muhammadan conquest by the Arabic author
<span class="sc">Alb&#275;r&#363;n&#299;</span>, who wrote his
<i>India</i> in 1030 A.D.</p>
<p>It is evident from what has been said, that before 500 A.D. literary
chronology, even in the Sanskrit period, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb14" href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>is almost entirely
relative, priority or posteriority being determined by such criteria as
development of style or thought, the mention of earlier authors by
name, stray political references as to the Greeks or to some well-known
dynasty, and allusions to astronomical facts which cannot have been
known before a certain epoch. Recent research, owing to increased
specialisation, has made considerable progress towards greater
chronological definiteness. More light will doubtless in course of time
come from the political history of early India, which is being
reconstructed, with great industry and ability, by various
distinguished scholars from the evidence of coins, copper-plate grants,
and rock or pillar inscriptions. These have been or are being published
in the <i>Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum</i>, the <i>Epigraphia
Indica</i>, and various journals devoted to the study of Indian
antiquities. The rise in the study of epigraphy during the last twenty
years has, indeed, already yielded some direct information of
importance about the literary and religious history of India, by fixing
the date of some of the later poets as well as by throwing light on
religious systems and whole classes of literature. Thus some metrical
inscriptions of considerable length have been deciphered, which prove
the existence of court poetry in Sanskrit and vernacular dialects from
the first century of our era onwards. No direct evidence of this fact
had previously been known.</p>
<p>The older inscriptions are also important in connection with
Sanskrit literature as illustrating both the early history of Indian
writing and the state of the language at the time. The oldest of them
are the rock and pillar inscriptions, dating from the middle of the
third century B.C., of the great Buddhist king <span class=
"sc">A&ccedil;oka</span>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href=
"#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>who ruled over Northern India from
259 to 222 B.C., and during whose reign was held the third Buddhist
council, at which the canon of the Buddhist scriptures was probably
fixed. The importance of these inscriptions can hardly be over-rated
for the value of the information to be derived from them about the
political, religious, and linguistic conditions of the age. Found
scattered all over India, from Girnar (Giri-nagara) in Kathiawar to
Dhauli in Orissa, from Kapur-di-Giri, north of the Kabul river, to
Khalsi, they have been reproduced, deciphered, and translated. One of
them, engraved on a pillar erected by A&ccedil;oka to commemorate the
actual birthplace of Buddha, was discovered only at the close of
1896.</p>
<p>These A&ccedil;oka inscriptions are the earliest records of Indian
writing. The question of the origin and age of writing in India, long
involved in doubt and controversy, has been greatly cleared up by the
recent pal&aelig;ographical researches of Professor <span class=
"sc">B&uuml;hler</span>. That great scholar has shown, that of the two
kinds of script known in ancient India, the one called
<i>Kharosh&#7789;h&#299;</i> employed in the country of Gandh&#257;ra
(Eastern Afghanistan and Northern Panj&#257;b) from the fourth century
B.C. to 200 A.D., was borrowed from the Aramaic type of Semitic writing
in use during the fifth century B.C. It was always written from right
to left, like its original. The other ancient Indian script, called
<i>Br&#257;hm&#299;</i>, is, as B&uuml;hler shows, the true national
writing of India, because all later Indian alphabets are descended from
it, however dissimilar many of them may appear at the present day. It
was regularly written from left to right; but that this was not its
original direction is indicated by a coin of the fourth century B.C.,
the inscription on which runs <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href=
"#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>from right to left. Dr. B&uuml;hler
has shown that this writing is based on the oldest Northern Semitic or
Ph&oelig;nician type, represented on Assyrian weights and on the
Moabite stone, which dates from about 890 B.C. He argues, with much
probability, that it was introduced about 800 B.C. into India by
traders coming by way of Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>References to writing in ancient Indian literature are, it is true,
very rare and late; in no case, perhaps, earlier than the fourth
century B.C., or not very long before the date of the A&ccedil;oka
inscriptions. Little weight, however, can be attached to the
<i>argumentum ex silentio</i> in this instance. For though writing has
now been extensively in use for an immense period, the native learning
of the modern Indian is still based on oral tradition. The sacred
scriptures as well as the sciences can only be acquired from the lips
of a teacher, not from a manuscript; and as only memorial knowledge is
accounted of value, writing and MSS. are rarely mentioned. Even modern
poets do not wish to be read, but cherish the hope that their works may
be recited. This immemorial practice, indeed, shows that the beginnings
of Indian poetry and science go back to a time when writing was
unknown, and a system of oral tradition, such as is referred to in the
<i>Rigveda</i>, was developed before writing was introduced. The latter
could, therefore, have been in use long before it began to be
mentioned. The pal&aelig;ographical evidence of the A&ccedil;oka
inscriptions, in any case, clearly shows that writing was no recent
invention in the third century B.C., for most of the letters have
several, often very divergent forms, sometimes as many as nine or ten.
A considerable length of time was, moreover, needed to elaborate from
the twenty-two borrowed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href=
"#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>Semitic symbols the full
<i>Br&#257;hm&#299;</i> alphabet of forty-six letters. This complete
alphabet, which was evidently worked out by learned Brahmans on
phonetic principles, must have existed by 500 B.C., according to the
strong arguments adduced by Professor B&uuml;hler. This is the alphabet
which is recognised in P&#257;&#7751;nini&rsquo;s great Sanskrit
grammar of about the fourth century B.C., and has remained unmodified
ever since. It not only represents all the sounds of the Sanskrit
language, but is arranged on a thoroughly scientific method, the simple
vowels (short and long) coming first, then the diphthongs, and lastly
the consonants in uniform groups according to the organs of speech with
which they are pronounced. Thus the dental consonants appear together
as <i>t</i>, <i>th</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>dh</i>, <i>n</i>, and the labials
as <i>p</i>, <i>ph</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>bh</i>, <i>m</i>. We Europeans, on
the other hand, 2500 years later, and in a scientific age, still employ
an alphabet which is not only inadequate to represent all the sounds of
our languages, but even preserves the random order in which vowels and
consonants are jumbled up as they were in the Greek adaptation of the
primitive Semitic arrangement of 3000 years ago.</p>
<p>In the inscriptions of the third century B.C. two types, the
Northern and the Southern, may be distinguished in the
<i>Br&#257;hm&#299;</i> writing. From the former is descended the group
of Northern scripts which gradually prevailed in all the Aryan dialects
of India. The most important of them is the <i>N&#257;gar&#299;</i>
(also called <i>Devan&#257;gar&#299;</i>), in which Sanskrit MSS. are
usually written, and Sanskrit as well as Mar&#257;&#7789;h&#299; and
Hind&#299; books are regularly printed. It is recognisable by the
characteristic horizontal line at the top of the letters. The oldest
inscription engraved entirely in <i>N&#257;gar&#299;</i> belongs to the
eighth, and the oldest MS. written in it to the eleventh century. From
the Southern <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>variety of the <i>Br&#257;hm&#299;</i> writing are
descended five types of script, all in use south of the Vindhya range.
Among them are the characters employed in the Canarese and the Telugu
country.</p>
<p>Owing to the perishability of the material on which they are
written, Sanskrit MSS. older than the fourteenth century A.D. are rare.
The two ancient materials used in India were strips of birch bark and
palm leaves. The employment of the former, beginning in the North-West
of India, where extensive birch forests clothe the slopes of the
Him&#257;laya, gradually spread to Central, Eastern, and Western India.
The oldest known Sanskrit MS. written on birch bark dates from the
fifth century A.D., and a P&#257;li MS. in <i>Kharosh&#7789;h&#299;</i>
which became known in 1897, is still older, but the use of this
material doubtless goes back to far earlier days. Thus we have the
statement of Quintus Curtius that the Indians employed it for writing
on at the time of Alexander. The testimony of classical Sanskrit
authors, as well as of Alb&#275;r&#363;n&#299;, shows that leaves of
birch bark (<i>bh&#363;rja-pattra</i>) were also regularly used for
letter-writing in early medi&aelig;val India.</p>
<p>The first example of a palm leaf Sanskrit MS. belongs to the sixth
century A.D. It is preserved in Japan, but there is a facsimile of it
in the Bodleian Library. According to the Chinese pilgrim Hiouen
Thsang, the use of the palm leaf was common all over India in the
seventh century; but that it was known many centuries earlier is proved
by the fact that an inscribed copper-plate, dating from the first
century A.D. at the latest, imitates a palm leaf in shape.</p>
<p>Paper was introduced by the Muhammadan conquest, and has been very
extensively used since that time for the writing of MSS. The oldest
known example of a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19"
name="pb19">19</a>]</span>paper Sanskrit MS. written in India is one
from Gujarat, belonging to the early part of the thirteenth century. In
Northern India, where ink was employed for writing, palm leaves went
out of use after the introduction of paper. But in the South, where a
stilus has always been employed for scratching in the character, palm
leaves are still common for writing both MSS. and letters. The birch
bark and palm leaf MSS. are held together by a cord drawn through a
single hole in the middle, or through two placed some distance apart.
This explains how the Sanskrit word for &ldquo;knot,&rdquo;
<i>grantha</i>, came to acquire the sense of &ldquo;book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leather or parchment has never been utilised in India for MSS.,
owing to the ritual impurity of animal materials. For inscriptions
copper-plates were early and frequently employed. They regularly
imitate the shape of either palm leaves or strips of birch bark.</p>
<p>The actual use of ink (the oldest Indian name of which is
<i>mashi</i>) is proved for the second century B.C. by an inscription
from a Buddhist relic mound, and is rendered very probable for the
fourth century B.C. by the statements of Nearchos and Quintus
Curtius.</p>
<p>All the old palm leaf, birch bark, and paper Sanskrit MSS. have been
written with ink and a reed pen, usually called <i>kalama</i> (a term
borrowed from the Greek <i>kalamos</i>). In Southern India, on the
other hand, it has always been the practice to scratch the writing on
palm leaves with a stilus, the characters being subsequently blackened
by soot or charcoal being rubbed into them.</p>
<p>Sanskrit MSS. of every kind are usually kept between thin strips of
wood with cords wound round them, and wrapped up in coloured, sometimes
embroidered, cloths. They have been, and still are, preserved in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>libraries of temples, monasteries, colleges, the
courts of princes, as well as private houses. A famous library was
owned by King Bhoja of Dh&#257;r in the eleventh century. That
considerable private libraries existed in fairly early times is shown
by the fact that the Sanskrit author <span class="sc">B&#257;na</span>
(about 620 A.D.) had in his employment a reader of manuscripts. Even at
the present day there are many excellent libraries of Sanskrit MSS. in
the possession of Brahmans all over India.</p>
<p>The ancient Indian language, like the literature composed in it,
falls into the two main divisions of Vedic and Sanskrit. The former
differs from the latter on the whole about as much as Homeric from
classical Greek, or the Latin of the Salic hymns from that of Varro.
Within the Vedic language, in which the sacred literature of India is
written, several stages can be distinguished. In its transitions from
one to the other it gradually grows more modern till it is ultimately
merged in Sanskrit. Even in its earliest phase Vedic cannot be regarded
as a popular tongue, but is rather an artificially archaic dialect,
handed down from one generation to the other within the class of
priestly singers. Of this the language itself supplies several
indications. One of them is the employment side by side of forms
belonging to different linguistic periods, a practice in which,
however, the Vedic does not go so far as the Homeric dialect. The
spoken language of the Vedic priests probably differed from this
dialect of the hymns only in the absence of poetical constructions and
archaisms. There was, in fact, even in the earlier Vedic age, a caste
language, such as is to be found more or less wherever a literature has
grown up; but in India it has been more strongly marked than in any
other country. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span></p>
<p>If, however, Vedic was no longer a natural tongue, but was already
the scholastic dialect of a class, how much truer is this of the
language of the later literature! Sanskrit differs from Vedic, but not
in conformity with the natural development which appears in living
languages. The phonetic condition of Sanskrit remains almost exactly
the same as that of the earliest Vedic. In the matter of grammatical
forms, too, the language shows itself to be almost stationary; for
hardly any new formations or inflexions have made their appearance. Yet
even from a grammatical point of view the later language has become
very different from the earlier. This change was therefore brought
about, not by new creations, but by successive losses. The most notable
of these were the disappearance of the subjunctive mood and the
reduction of a dozen infinitives to a single one. In declension the
change consisted chiefly in the dropping of a number of synonymous
by-forms. It is probable that the spoken Vedic, more modern and less
complex than that of the hymns, to some extent affected the later
literary language in the direction of simplification. But the changes
in the language were mainly due to the regulating efforts of the
grammarians, which were more powerful in India than anywhere else,
owing to the early and exceptional development of grammatical studies
in that country. Their influence alone can explain the elaborate nature
of the phonetic combinations (called <i>Sandhi</i>) between the finals
and initials of words in the Sanskrit sentence.</p>
<p>It is, however, the vocabulary of the language that has undergone
the greatest modifications, as is indeed the case in all literary
dialects; for it is beyond the power of grammarians to control change
in this direction. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22"
name="pb22">22</a>]</span>Thus we find that the vocabulary has been
greatly extended by derivation and composition according to recognised
types. At the same time there are numerous words which, though old,
seem to be new only because they happen by accident not to occur in the
Vedic literature. Many really new words have, however, come in through
continual borrowings from a lower stratum of language, while already
existing words have undergone great changes of meaning.</p>
<p>This later phase of the ancient language of India was stereotyped by
the great grammarian <span class="sc">P&#257;&#7751;ini</span> towards
the end of the fourth century B.C. It came to be called Sanskrit, the
&ldquo;refined&rdquo; or &ldquo;elaborate&rdquo;
(<i>sam&#803;-sk&#7771;i-ta</i>, literally &ldquo;put together&rdquo;),
a term not found in the older grammarians, but occurring in the
earliest epic, the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i>. The name is meant
to be opposed to that of the popular dialects called
<i>Pr&#257;k&#7771;ita</i>, and is so opposed, for instance, in the
<i>K&#257;vy&#257;dar&ccedil;a</i>, or <i>Mirror of Poetry</i>, a work
of the sixth century A.D. The older grammarians themselves, from
<span class="sc">Y&#257;ska</span> (fifth century B.C.) onwards, speak
of this classical dialect as <i>Bh&#257;sh&#257;</i>, &ldquo;the
speech,&rdquo; in distinction from Vedic. The remarks they make about
it point to a spoken language. Thus one of them, <span class=
"sc">Patanjali</span>, refers to it as used &ldquo;in the world,&rdquo;
and designates the words of his Sanskrit as &ldquo;current in the
world.&rdquo; P&#257;&#7751;ini himself gives many rules which have no
significance except in connection with living speech; as when he
describes the accent or the lengthening of vowels in calling from a
distance, in salutation, or in question and answer. Again, Sanskrit
cannot have been a mere literary and school language, because there are
early traces of its having had dialectic variations. Thus Y&#257;ska
and P&#257;&#7751;ini mention the peculiarities <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>of the
&ldquo;Easterns&rdquo; and &ldquo;Northerners,&rdquo;
K&#257;ty&#257;yana refers to local divergences, and Patanjali
specifies words occurring in single districts only. There is, indeed,
no doubt that in the second century B.C. Sanskrit was actually spoken
in the whole country called by Sanskrit writers &#256;ry&#257;varta, or
&ldquo;Land of the Aryans,&rdquo; which lies between the Him&#257;laya
and the Vindhya range. But who spoke it there? Brahmans certainly did;
for Patanjali speaks of them as the &ldquo;instructed&rdquo;
(<i>&ccedil;ish&#7789;a</i>), the employers of correct speech. Its use,
however, extended beyond the Brahmans; for we read in Patanjali about a
head-groom disputing with a grammarian as to the etymology of the
Sanskrit word for &ldquo;charioteer&rdquo; (<i>s&#363;ta</i>). This
agrees with the distribution of the dialects in the Indian drama, a
distribution doubtless based on a tradition much older than the plays
themselves. Here the king and those of superior rank speak Sanskrit,
while the various forms of the popular dialect are assigned to women
and to men of the people. The dramas also show that whoever did not
speak Sanskrit at any rate understood it, for Sanskrit is there
employed in conversation with speakers of Pr&#257;krit. The theatrical
public, and that before which, as we know from frequent references in
the literature, the epics were recited, must also have understood
Sanskrit. Thus, though classical Sanskrit was from the beginning a
literary and, in a sense, an artificial dialect, it would be erroneous
to deny to it altogether the character of a colloquial language. It is
indeed, as has already been mentioned, even now actually spoken in
India by learned Brahmans, as well as written by them, for every-day
purposes. The position of Sanskrit, in short, has all along been, and
still is, much like that of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href=
"#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span>Hebrew among the Jews or of Latin in
the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>Whoever was familiar with Sanskrit at the same time spoke one
popular language or more. The question as to what these popular
languages were brings us to the relation of Sanskrit to the vernaculars
of India. The linguistic importance of the ancient literary speech for
the India of to-day will become apparent when it is pointed out that
all the modern dialects&mdash;excepting those of a few isolated
aboriginal hill tribes&mdash;spoken over the whole vast territory
between the mouths of the Indus and those of the Ganges, between the
Him&#257;laya and the Vindhya range, besides the Bombay Presidency as
far south as the Portuguese settlement of Goa, are descended from the
oldest form of Sanskrit. Starting from their ancient source in the
north-west, they have overflowed in more and more diverging streams the
whole peninsula except the extreme south-east. The beginnings of these
popular dialects go back to a period of great antiquity. Even at the
time when the Vedic hymns were composed, there must have existed a
popular language which already differed widely in its phonetic aspect
from the literary dialect. For the Vedic hymns contain several words of
a phonetic type which can only be explained by borrowings on the part
of their composers from popular speech.</p>
<p>We further know that in the sixth century B.C., Buddha preached his
gospel in the language of the people, as opposed to that of the
learned, in order that all might understand him. Thus all the oldest
Buddhist literature dating from the fourth or fifth century B.C. was
composed in the vernacular, originally doubtless in the dialect of
Magadha (the modern Behar), the birthplace of Buddhism. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>Like
Italian, as compared with Latin, this early popular speech is
characterised by the avoidance of conjunct consonants and by fondness
for final vowels. Thus the Sanskrit <i>s&#363;tra</i>,
&ldquo;thread,&rdquo; and <i>dharma</i>, &ldquo;duty,&rdquo; become
<i>sutta</i> and <i>dhamma</i> respectively, while <i>vidyut</i>,
&ldquo;lightning,&rdquo; is transformed into <i>vijju</i>. The
particular form of the popular language which became the sacred idiom
of Southern Buddhism is known by the name of P&#257;li. Its original
home is still uncertain, but its existence as early as the third
century B.C. is proved beyond the range of doubt by the numerous rock
and pillar inscriptions of A&ccedil;oka. This dialect was in the third
century B.C. introduced into Ceylon, and became the basis of
Singhalese, the modern language of the island. It was through the
influence of Buddhism that, from A&ccedil;oka&rsquo;s time onwards, the
official decrees and documents preserved in inscriptions were for
centuries composed exclusively in Middle Indian (Pr&#257;krit)
dialects. Sanskrit was not familiar to the chanceries during these
centuries, though the introduction of Sanskrit verses in Pr&#257;krit
inscriptions shows that Sanskrit was alive during this period, and
proves its continuity for literary purposes. The older tradition of
both the Buddhist and the Jain religion, in fact, ignored Sanskrit
entirely, using only the popular dialects for all purposes.</p>
<p>But in course of time both the Buddhists and the Jains endeavoured
to acquire a knowledge of Sanskrit. This led to the formation of an
idiom which, being in the main Pr&#257;krit, was made to resemble the
old language by receiving Sanskrit endings and undergoing other
adaptations. It is therefore decidedly wrong to consider this
artificial dialect an intermediate stage between Sanskrit and
P&#257;li. This peculiar type of language is most <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>pronounced in the poetical pieces called
<i>g&#257;th&#257;</i> or &ldquo;song,&rdquo; which occur in the
canonical works of the Northern Buddhists, especially in the
<i>Lalita-vistara</i>, a life of Buddha. Hence it was formerly called
the G&#257;th&#257; dialect. The term is, however, inaccurate, as
Buddhist prose works have also been written in this mixed language.</p>
<p>The testimony of the inscriptions is instructive in showing the
gradual encroachment of Sanskrit on the popular dialects used by the
two non-Brahmanical religions. Thus in the Jain inscriptions of
Mathur&#257; (now Muttra), an almost pure Pr&#257;krit prevails down to
the first century A.D. After that Sanskritisms become more and more
frequent, till at last simple Sanskrit is written. Similarly in
Buddhist inscriptions pure Pr&#257;krit is relieved by the mixed
dialect, the latter by Sanskrit. Thus in the inscriptions of
N&#257;sik, in Western India, the mixed dialect extends into the third,
while Sanskrit first begins in the second century A.D. From the sixth
century onwards Sanskrit prevails exclusively (except among the Jains)
in inscriptions, though Pr&#257;kritisms often occur in them. Even in
the literature of Buddhism the mixed dialect was gradually supplanted
by Sanskrit. Hence most of the Northern Buddhist texts have come down
to us in Sanskrit, which, however, diverges widely in vocabulary from
that of the sacred texts of the Brahmans, as well as from that of the
classical literature, since they are full of Pr&#257;krit words. It is
expressly attested by the Chinese pilgrim, Hiouen Thsang, that in the
seventh century the Buddhists used Sanskrit even in oral theological
discussions. The Jains finally did the same, though without entirely
giving up Pr&#257;krit. Thus by the time of the Muhammadan conquest
Sanskrit was almost the only <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href=
"#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>written language of India. But while
Sanskrit was recovering its ancient supremacy, the Pr&#257;krits had
exercised a lasting influence upon it in two respects. They had
supplied its vocabulary with a number of new words, and had transformed
into a stress accent the old musical accent which still prevailed after
the days of P&#257;&#7751;ini.</p>
<p>In the oldest period of Pr&#257;krit, that of the P&#257;li
A&ccedil;oka inscriptions and the early Buddhistic and Jain literature,
two main dialects, the Western and the Eastern, may be distinguished.
Between the beginning of our era and about 1000 A.D., medi&aelig;val
Pr&#257;krit, which is still synthetic in character, is divided into
four chief dialects. In the west we find <i>Apabhram&#803;&ccedil;a</i>
(&ldquo;decadent&rdquo;) in the valley of the Indus, and
<i>&Ccedil;aurasen&#299;</i> in the Doab, with Mathur&#257; as its
centre. Subdivisions of the latter were <i>Gaurjar&#299;</i>
(<i>Gujarat&#299;</i>), <i>Avant&#299;</i> (Western
<i>R&#257;jput&#257;n&#299;</i>), and
<i>Mah&#257;r&#257;sh&#7789;r&#299;</i> (Eastern
<i>R&#257;jput&#257;n&#299;</i>). The Eastern Pr&#257;krit now appears
as <i>M&#257;gadh&#299;</i>, the dialect of Magadha, now Behar, and
<i>Ardha-M&#257;gadh&#299;</i> (Half-M&#257;gadh&#299;), with Benares
as its centre. These medi&aelig;val Pr&#257;krits are important in
connection with Sanskrit literature, as they are the vernaculars
employed by the uneducated classes in the Sanskrit drama.</p>
<p>They are the sources of all the Aryan languages of modern India.
From the <i>Apabhram&#803;&ccedil;a</i> are derived <i>Sindh&#299;</i>,
Western <i>Panj&#257;b&#299;</i>, and <i>Kashm&#299;r&#299;</i>; from
<i>&Ccedil;aurasen&#299;</i> come Eastern <i>Panj&#257;b&#299;</i> and
<i>Hind&#299;</i> (the old <i>Avant&#299;</i>), as well as
<i>Gujarat&#299;</i>; while from the two forms of
<i>M&#257;gadh&#299;</i> are descended <i>Mar&#257;&#7789;h&#299;</i>
on the one hand, and the various dialects of Bengal on the other. These
modern vernaculars, which began to develop from about 1000 A.D., are no
longer inflexional languages, but are analytical like English, forming
an interesting parallel in their development <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>from
ancient Sanskrit to the Romance dialects in their derivation from
Latin. They have developed literatures of their own, which are based
entirely on that of Sanskrit. The non-Aryan languages of the Dekhan,
the Dravidian group, including Telugu, Canarese, Mal&#257;yalam, and
Tamil, have not indeed been ousted by Aryan tongues, but they are full
of words borrowed from Sanskrit, while their literature is dominated by
Sanskrit models. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=

<h2 class="label">Chapter II</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Vedic Period</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the very threshold of Indian literature more than
three thousand years ago, we are confronted with a body of lyrical
poetry which, although far older than the literary monuments of any
other branch of the Indo-European family, is already distinguished by
refinement and beauty of thought, as well as by skill in the handling
of language and metre. From this point, for a period of more than a
thousand years, Indian literature bears an exclusively religious stamp;
even those latest productions of the Vedic age which cannot be called
directly religious are yet meant to further religious ends. This is,
indeed, implied by the term &ldquo;Vedic.&rdquo; For <i>veda</i>,
primarily signifying &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; (from <i>vid</i>,
&ldquo;to know&rdquo;), designates &ldquo;sacred lore,&rdquo; as a
branch of literature. Besides this general sense, the word has also the
restricted meaning of &ldquo;sacred book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Vedic period three well-defined literary strata are to be
distinguished. The first is that of the four Vedas, the outcome of a
creative and poetic age, in which hymns and prayers were composed
chiefly to accompany the pressing and offering of the Soma juice or the
oblation of melted butter (<i>gh&#7771;ita</i>) to the gods. The four
Vedas are &ldquo;collections,&rdquo; called <i>sam&#803;hit&#257;</i>,
of hymns and prayers made for different ritual purposes. They are of
varying age and significance. By far the most <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>important as well as the oldest&mdash;for it is
the very foundation of all Vedic literature&mdash;is the
<i>Rigveda</i>, the &ldquo;Veda of verses&rdquo; (from
<i>&#7771;ich</i>, &ldquo;a laudatory stanza&rdquo;), consisting
entirely of lyrics, mainly in praise of different gods. It may,
therefore, be described as the book of hymns or psalms. The
<i>S&#257;ma-veda</i> has practically no independent value, for it
consists entirely of stanzas (excepting only 75) taken from the
<i>Rigveda</i> and arranged solely with reference to their place in the
Soma sacrifice. Being meant to be sung to certain fixed melodies, it
may be called the book of chants (<i>s&#257;man</i>). The
<i>Yajur-veda</i> differs in one essential respect from the
<i>S&#257;ma-veda</i>, It consists not only of stanzas
(<i>&#7771;ich</i>), mostly borrowed from the <i>Rigveda</i>, but also
of original prose formulas. It resembles the <i>S&#257;ma-veda</i>,
however, in having its contents arranged in the order in which it was
actually employed in various sacrifices. It is, therefore, a book of
sacrificial prayers (<i>yajus</i>). The matter of this Veda has been
handed down in two forms. In the one, the sacrificial formulas only are
given; in the other, these are to a certain extent intermingled with
their explanations. These three Vedas alone were at first recognised as
canonical scriptures, being in the next stage of Vedic literature
comprehensively spoken of as &ldquo;the threefold knowledge&rdquo;
(<i>tray&#299; vidy&#257;</i>).</p>
<p>The fourth collection, the <i>Atharva-veda</i>, attained to this
position only after a long struggle. Judged both by its language and by
that portion of its matter which is analogous to the contents of the
<i>Rigveda</i>, the <i>Atharva-veda</i> came into existence
considerably later than that Veda. In form it is similar to the
<i>Rigveda</i>, consisting for the most part of metrical hymns, many of
which are taken from the last book of the older collection. In
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>spirit, however, it is not only entirely different
from the <i>Rigveda</i>, but represents a much more primitive stage of
thought. While the <i>Rigveda</i> deals almost exclusively with the
higher gods as conceived by a comparatively advanced and refined
sacerdotal class, the <i>Atharva-veda</i> is, in the main, a book of
spells and incantations appealing to the demon world, and teems with
notions about witchcraft current among the lower grades of the
population, and derived from an immemorial antiquity. These two, thus
complementary to each other in contents, are obviously the most
important of the four Vedas. As representing religious ideas at an
earlier stage than any other literary monuments of the ancient world,
they are of inestimable value to those who study the evolution of
religious beliefs.</p>
<p>The creative period of the Vedas at length came to an end. It was
followed by an epoch in which there no longer seemed any need to offer
up new prayers to the gods, but it appeared more meritorious to repeat
those made by the holy seers of bygone generations, and handed down
from father to son in various priestly families. The old hymns thus
came to be successively gathered together in the Vedic collections
already mentioned and in this form acquired an ever-increasing
sanctity. Having ceased to produce poetry, the priesthood transferred
their creative energies to the elaboration of the sacrificial
ceremonial. The result was a ritual system far surpassing in complexity
of detail anything the world has elsewhere known. The main importance
of the old Vedic hymns and formulas now came to be their application to
the innumerable details of the sacrifice. Around this combination of
sacred verse and rite a new body of doctrine grew up in sacerdotal
tradition, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>and finally assumed definite shape in the guise of
distinct theological treatises entitled <i>Br&#257;hma&#7751;as</i>,
&ldquo;books dealing with devotion or prayer&rdquo; (<i>brahman</i>).
They evidently did not come into being till a time when the hymns were
already deemed ancient and sacred revelations, the priestly custodians
of which no longer fully understood their meaning owing to the change
undergone by the language. They are written in prose throughout, and
are in some cases accented, like the Vedas themselves. They are thus
notable as representing the oldest prose writing of the Indo-European
family. Their style is, indeed, cumbrous, rambling, and disjointed, but
distinct progress towards greater facility is observable within this
literary period.</p>
<p>The chief purpose of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as is to explain the
mutual relation of the sacred text and the ceremonial, as well as their
symbolical meaning with reference to each other. With the exception of
the occasional legends and striking thoughts which occur in them, they
cannot be said to be at all attractive as literary productions. To
support their explanations of the ceremonial, they interweave
exegetical, linguistic, and etymological observations, and introduce
myths and philosophical speculations in confirmation of their
cosmogonic and theosophic theories. They form an aggregate of shallow
and pedantic discussions, full of sacerdotal conceits, and fanciful, or
even absurd, identifications, such as is doubtless unparalleled
anywhere else. Yet, as the oldest treatises on ritual practices extant
in any literature, they are of great interest to the student of the
history of religions in general, besides furnishing much important
material to the student of Indian antiquity in particular. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span></p>
<p>It results from what has been said that the contrasts between the
two older phases of Vedic literature are strongly marked. The Vedas are
poetical in matter and form; the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as are prosaic and
written in prose. The thought of the Vedas is on the whole natural and
concrete; that of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as artificial and abstract. The
chief significance of the Vedas lies in their mythology; that of the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;as in their ritual.</p>
<p>The subject-matter of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as which are attached to
the various Vedas, differs according to the divergent duties performed
by the kind of priest connected with each Veda. The
Br&#257;hma&#7751;as of the <i>Rigveda</i>, in explaining the ritual,
usually limit themselves to the duties of the priest called
<i>hot&#7771;i</i> or &ldquo;reciter&rdquo; on whom it was incumbent to
form the canon (<i>&ccedil;astra</i>) for each particular rite, by
selecting from the hymns the verses applicable to it. The
Br&#257;hma&#7751;as of the <i>S&#257;ma-veda</i> are concerned only
with the duties of the <i>udg&#257;t&#7771;i</i> or
&ldquo;chanter&rdquo; of the S&#257;mans; the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as of
the <i>Yajur-veda</i> with those of the <i>adhvaryu</i>, or the priest
who is the actual sacrificer. Again, the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as of the
<i>Rigveda</i> more or less follow the order of the ritual, quite
irrespectively of the succession of the hymns in the Veda itself. The
Br&#257;hma&#7751;as of the <i>S&#257;ma-</i> and the
<i>Yajur-veda</i>, on the other hand, follow the order of their
respective Vedas, which are already arranged in the ritual sequence.
The Br&#257;hma&#7751;a of the <i>S&#257;ma-veda</i>, however, rarely
explains individual verses, while that of the <i>Yajur-veda</i>
practically forms a running commentary on all the verses of the
text.</p>
<p>The period of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as is a very important one in
the history of Indian society. For in it the system of the four castes
assumed definite shape, furnishing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34"
href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>the frame within which the
highly complex network of the castes of to-day has been developed. In
that system the priesthood, who even in the first Vedic period had
occupied an influential position, secured for themselves the dominant
power which they have maintained ever since. The life of no other
people has been so saturated with sacerdotal influence as that of the
Hindus, among whom sacred learning is still the monopoly of the
hereditary priestly caste. While in other early societies the chief
power remained in the hands of princes and warrior nobles, the
domination of the priesthood became possible in India as soon as the
energetic life of conquest during the early Vedic times in the
north-west was followed by a period of physical inactivity or indolence
in the plains. Such altered conditions enabled the cultured class, who
alone held the secret of the all-powerful sacrifice, to gain the
supremacy of intellect over physical force.</p>
<p>The Br&#257;hma&#7751;as in course of time themselves acquired a
sacred character, and came in the following period to be classed along
with the hymns as <i>&ccedil;ruti</i> or &ldquo;hearing,&rdquo; that
which was directly heard by or, as we should say, revealed to, the holy
sages of old. In the sphere of revelation are included the later
portions of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as, which form treatises of a
specially theosophic character, and being meant to be imparted or
studied in the solitude of the forest, are called
<i>&#256;ra&#7751;yakas</i> or &ldquo;Forest-books.&rdquo; The final
part of these, again, are philosophical books named <i>Upanishads</i>,
which belong to the latest stage of Br&#257;hma&#7751;a literature. The
pantheistic groundwork of their doctrine was later developed into the
Ved&#257;nta system, which is still the favourite philosophy of the
modern Hindus. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span></p>
<p>Works of Vedic &ldquo;revelation&rdquo; were deemed of higher
authority in cases of doubt than the later works on religious and civil
usage, called <i>sm&#7771;iti</i> or &ldquo;memory,&rdquo; as embodying
only the tradition derived from ancient sages.</p>
<p>We have now arrived at the third and last stage of Vedic literature,
that of the S&#363;tras. These are compendious treatises dealing with
Vedic ritual on the one hand, and with customary law on the other. The
rise of this class of writings was due to the need of reducing the vast
and growing mass of details in ritual and custom, preserved in the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;as and in floating tradition, to a systematic shape,
and of compressing them within a compass which did not impose too great
a burden on the memory, the vehicle of all teaching and learning. The
main object of the S&#363;tras is, therefore, to supply a short survey
of the sum of these scattered details. They are not concerned with the
interpretation of ceremonial or custom, but aim at giving a plain and
methodical account of the whole course of the rites or practices with
which they deal. For this purpose the utmost brevity was needed, a
requirement which was certainly met in a manner unparalleled elsewhere.
The very name of this class of literature, <i>s&#363;tra</i>,
&ldquo;thread&rdquo; or &ldquo;clue&rdquo; (from <i>siv</i>, &ldquo;to
sew&rdquo;), points to its main characteristic and chief
object&mdash;extreme conciseness. The prose in which these works are
composed is so compressed that the wording of the most laconic telegram
would often appear diffuse compared with it. Some of the S&#363;tras
attain to an almost algebraic mode of expression, the formulas of which
cannot be understood without the help of detailed commentaries. A
characteristic aphorism has been preserved, which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>illustrates this straining after brevity.
According to it, the composers of grammatical S&#363;tras delight as
much in the saving of a short vowel as in the birth of a son. The full
force of this remark can only be understood when it is remembered that
a Brahman is deemed incapable of gaining heaven without a son to
perform his funeral rites.</p>
<p>Though the works comprised in each class of S&#363;tras are
essentially the same in character, it is natural to suppose that their
composition extended over some length of time, and that those which are
more concise and precise in their wording are the more recent; for the
evolution of their style is obviously in the direction of increased
succinctness. Research, it is true, has hitherto failed to arrive at
any definite result as to the date of their composition. Linguistic
investigations, however, tend to show that the S&#363;tras are closely
connected in time with the grammarian P&#257;&#7751;ini, some of them
appearing to be considerably anterior to him. We shall, therefore,
probably not go very far wrong in assigning 500 and 200 B.C. as the
chronological limits within which the S&#363;tra literature was
developed.</p>
<p>The tradition of the Vedic ritual was handed down in two forms. The
one class, called <i>&Ccedil;rauta S&#363;tras</i>, because based on
<i>&ccedil;ruti</i> or revelation (by which in this case the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;as are chiefly meant), deal with the ritual of the
greater sacrifices, for the performance of which three or more sacred
fires, as well as the ministrations of priests, are necessary. Not one
of them presents a complete picture of the sacrifice, because each of
them, like the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as, describes only the duties of one
or other of the three kinds of priests attached to the respective
Vedas. In order to obtain a full description of each <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>ritual
ceremony, it is therefore needful to supplement the account given by
one &Ccedil;rauta S&#363;tra from that furnished by the rest.</p>
<p>The other division of the ritual S&#363;tras is based on
<i>sm&#7771;iti</i> or tradition. These are the <i>G&#7771;ihya
S&#363;tras</i>, or &ldquo;House Aphorisms,&rdquo; which deal with the
household ceremonies, or the rites to be performed with the domestic
fire in daily life. As a rule, these rites are not performed by a
priest, but by the householder himself in company with his wife. For
this reason there is, apart from deviations in arrangement and
expression, omission or addition, no essential difference between the
various G&#7771;ihya S&#363;tras, except that the verses to be repeated
which they contain are taken from the Veda to which they belong. Each
G&#7771;ihya S&#363;tra, besides being attached to and referring to the
&Ccedil;rauta S&#363;tra of the same school, presupposes a knowledge of
it. But though thus connected, the two do not form a unity.</p>
<p>The second class of S&#363;tras, which deal with social and legal
usage, is, like the G&#7771;ihya S&#363;tras, also based on
<i>sm&#7771;iti</i> or tradition. These are the <i>Dharma
S&#363;tras</i>, which are in general the oldest sources of Indian law.
As is implied by the term <i>dharma</i>, &ldquo;religion and
morality,&rdquo; their point of view is chiefly a religious one. They
are closely connected with the Veda, which they quote, and which the
later law-books regard as the first and highest source of
<i>dharma</i>.</p>
<p>From the intensely crabbed and unintelligible nature of their style,
and the studied baldness with which they present their subjects, it is
evident that the S&#363;tras are inferior even to the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;as as literary productions. Judged, however, with
regard to its matter, this strange phase of literature has considerable
value. In all other <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38"
name="pb38">38</a>]</span>ancient literatures knowledge of sacrificial
rites can only be gained by collecting stray references. But in the
ritual S&#363;tras we possess the ancient manuals which the priests
used as the foundation of their sacrificial lore. Their statements are
so systematic and detailed that it is possible to reconstruct from them
various sacrifices without having seen them performed. They are thus of
great importance for the history of religious institutions. But the
S&#363;tras have a further value. For, as the life of the Hindu, more
than that of any other nation, was, even in the Vedic age, surrounded
with a network of religious forms, both in its daily course and in its
more important divisions, the domestic ritual as well as the legal
S&#363;tras are our most important sources for the study of the social
conditions of ancient India. They are the oldest Indian records of all
that is included under custom.</p>
<p>Besides these ritual and legal compendia, the S&#363;tra period
produced several classes of works composed in this style, which, though
not religious in character, had a religious origin. They arose from the
study of the Vedas, which was prompted by the increasing difficulty of
understanding the hymns, and of reciting them correctly, in consequence
of the changes undergone by the language. Their chief object was to
ensure the right recitation and interpretation of the sacred text. One
of the most important classes of this ancillary literature comprises
the <i>Pr&#257;ti&ccedil;&#257;khya S&#363;tras</i>, which, dealing
with accentuation, pronunciation, metre, and other matters, are chiefly
concerned with the phonetic changes undergone by Vedic words when
combined in a sentence. They contain a number of minute observations,
such as have only been made over again by the phoneticians of the
present day in Europe. A still more <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39"
href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>important branch of this
subsidiary literature is grammar, in which the results attained by the
Indians in the systematic analysis of language surpass those arrived at
by any other nation. Little has been preserved of the earliest attempts
in this direction, for all that had been previously done was superseded
by the great S&#363;tra work of <span class=
"sc">P&#257;&#7751;ini</span>. Though belonging probably to the middle
of the S&#363;tra period, P&#257;&#7751;ini must be regarded as the
starting-point of the Sanskrit age, the literature of which is almost
entirely dominated by the linguistic standard stereotyped by him.</p>
<p>In the S&#363;tra period also arose a class of works specially
designed for preserving the text of the Vedas from loss or change.
These are the <i>Anukrama&#7751;&#299;s</i> or &ldquo;Indices,&rdquo;
which quote the first words of each hymn, its author, the deity
celebrated in it, the number of verses it contains, and the metre in
which it is composed. One of them states the total number of hymns,
verses, words, and even syllables, contained in the <i>Rigveda</i>,
besides supplying other details.</p>
<p>From this general survey of the Vedic period we now turn to a more
detailed consideration of the different phases of the literature it
produced. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the dim twilight preceding the dawn of Indian
literature the historical imagination can perceive the forms of Aryan
warriors, the first Western conquerors of Hindustan, issuing from those
passes in the north-west through which the tide of invasion has in
successive ages rolled to sweep over the plains of India. The earliest
poetry of this invading race, whose language and culture ultimately
overspread the whole continent, was composed while its tribes still
occupied the territories on both sides of the Indus now known as
Eastern Kabulistan and the Panj&#257;b. That ancient poetry has come
down to us in the form of a collection of hymns called the
<i>Rigveda</i>. The cause which gathered the poems it contains into a
single book was not practical, as in the case of the <i>S&#257;ma-</i>
and <i>Yajur-veda</i>, but scientific and historical. For its ancient
editors were undoubtedly impelled by the motive of guarding this
heritage of olden time from change and destruction. The number of hymns
comprised in the <i>Rigveda</i>, in the only recension which has been
preserved, that of the &Ccedil;&#257;kala school, is 1017, or, if the
eleven supplementary hymns (called <i>V&#257;lakhilya</i>) which are
inserted in the middle of the eighth book are added, 1028. These hymns
are grouped in ten books, called <i>ma&#7751;&#7693;alas</i>, or
&ldquo;cycles,&rdquo; which vary in length, except that the tenth
contains the same number <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href=
"#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>of hymns as the first. In bulk the
hymns of the <i>Rigveda</i> equal, it has been calculated, the
surviving poems of Homer.</p>
<p>The general character of the ten books is not identical in all
cases. Six of them (ii.&ndash;vii.) are homogeneous. Each of these, in
the first place, is the work of a different seer or his descendants
according to the ancient tradition, which is borne out by internal
evidence. They were doubtless long handed down separately in the
families to which they owed their being. Moreover, the hymns contained
in these &ldquo;family books,&rdquo; as they are usually called, are
arranged on a uniform plan differing from that of the rest. The first,
eighth, and tenth books are not the productions of a single family of
seers respectively, but consist of a number of groups based on identity
of authorship. The arrangement of the ninth book is in no way connected
with its composers; its unity is due to all its hymns being addressed
to the single deity Soma, while its groups depend on identity of metre.
The family books also contain groups; but each of these is formed of
hymns addressed to one and the same deity.</p>
<p>Turning to the principle on which the entire books of the
<i>Rigveda</i> are arranged in relation to one another, we find that
Books II.&ndash;VII., if allowance is made for later additions, form a
series of collections which contain a successively increasing number of
hymns. This fact, combined with the uniformity of these books in
general character and internal arrangement, renders it probable that
they formed the nucleus of the <i>Rigveda</i>, to which the remaining
books were successively added. It further seems likely that the nine
shorter collections, which form the second part of Book I., as being
similarly based on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42"
name="pb42">42</a>]</span>identity of authorship, were subsequently
combined and prefixed to the family books, which served as the model
for their internal arrangement.</p>
<p>The hymns of the eighth book in general show a mutual affinity
hardly less pronounced than that to be found in the family books. For
they are connected by numerous repetitions of similar phrases and lines
running through the whole book. The latter, however, does not form a
parallel to the family books. For though a single family, that of the
Ka&#7751;vas, at least predominates among its authors, the prevalence
in it of the strophic form of composition impresses upon it a character
of its own. Moreover, the fact that the eighth book contains fewer
hymns than the seventh, in itself shows that the former did not
constitute one of the family series.</p>
<p>The first part (1&ndash;50) of Book I. has considerable affinities
with the eighth, more than half its hymns being attributed to members
of the Ka&#7751;va family, while in the hymns composed by some of these
Ka&#7751;vas the favourite strophic metre of the eighth book reappears.
There are, moreover, numerous parallel and directly identical passages
in the two collections. It is, however, at present impossible to decide
which of the two is the earlier, or why it is that, though so nearly
related, they should have been separated. Certain it is that they were
respectively added at the beginning and the end of a previously
existing collection, whether they were divided for chronological
reasons or because composed by different branches of the Ka&#7751;va
family.</p>
<p>As to the ninth book, it cannot be doubted that it came into being
as a collection after the first eight books had been combined into a
whole. Its formation was in fact the direct result of that combination.
The hymns to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>Soma Pavam&#257;na (&ldquo;the clearly
flowing&rdquo;) are composed by authors of the same families as
produced Books II.&ndash;VII., a fact, apart from other evidence,
sufficiently indicated by their having the characteristic refrains of
those families. The Pavam&#257;na hymns have affinities to the first
and eighth books also. When the hymns of the different families were
combined into books, and clearly not till then, all their Pavam&#257;na
hymns were taken out and gathered into a single collection. This of
course does not imply that the Pavam&#257;na hymns themselves were of
recent origin. On the contrary, though some of them may date from the
time when the tenth book came into existence, there is good reason to
suppose that the poetry of the Soma hymns, which has many points in
common with the Avesta, and deals with a ritual going back to the
Indo-Iranian period, reached its conclusion as a whole in early times
among the Vedic singers. Differences of age in the hymns of the ninth
book have been almost entirely effaced; at any rate, research has as
yet hardly succeeded in distinguishing chronological stages in this
collection.</p>
<p>With regard to the tenth book, there can be no doubt that its hymns
came into being at a time when the first nine already existed. Its
composers grew up in the knowledge of the older books, with which they
betray their familiarity at every turn. The fact that the author of one
of its groups (20&ndash;26) begins with the opening words (<i>agnim
&#299;l&#803;e</i>) of the first stanza of the <i>Rigveda</i>, is
probably an indication that Books I.&ndash;IX. already existed in his
day even as a combined collection. That the tenth book is indeed an
aggregate of supplementary hymns is shown by its position after the
Soma book, and by the number of its hymns being made up to that of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>the first book (191). The unity which connects its
poetry is chronological; for it is the book of recent groups and recent
single hymns. Nevertheless the supplements collected in it appear for
the most part to be older than the additions which occur in the earlier
books.</p>
<p>There are many criteria, derived from its matter as well as its
form, showing the recent origin of the tenth book. With regard to
mythology, we find the earlier gods beginning to lose their hold on the
imagination of these later singers. Some of them seem to be
disappearing, like the goddess of Dawn, while only deities of widely
established popularity, such as Indra and Agni, maintain their
position. The comprehensive group of the <i>Vi&ccedil;ve
dev&#257;s</i>, or &ldquo;All gods,&rdquo; has alone increased in
prominence. On the other hand, an altogether new type, the deification
of purely abstract ideas, such as &ldquo;Wrath&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Faith,&rdquo; now appears for the first time. Here, too, a
number of hymns are found dealing with subjects foreign to the earlier
books, such as cosmogony and philosophical speculation, wedding and
burial rites, spells and incantations, which give to this book a
distinctive character besides indicating its recent origin.</p>
<p>Linguistically, also, the tenth book is clearly distinguished as
later than the other books, forming in many respects a transition to
the other Vedas. A few examples will here suffice to show this. Vowel
contractions occur much more frequently, while the hiatus has grown
rarer. The use of the letter <i>l</i>, as compared with <i>r</i>, is,
in agreement with later Sanskrit, strikingly on the increase. In
inflexion the employment of the Vedic nominative plural in
<i>&#257;sas</i> is on the decline. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45"
href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>With regard to the vocabulary,
many old words are going out of use, while others are becoming
commoner. Thus the particle <i>s&#299;m</i>, occurring fifty times in
the rest of the <i>Rigveda</i>, is found only once in the tenth book. A
number of words common in the later language are only to be met with in
this book; for instance, <i>labh</i>, &ldquo;to take,&rdquo;
<i>k&#257;la</i>, &ldquo;time,&rdquo; <i>lakshm&#299;</i>,
&ldquo;fortune,&rdquo; <i>evam</i>, &ldquo;thus.&rdquo; Here, too, a
number of conscious archaisms can be pointed out.</p>
<p>Thus the tenth book represents a definitely later stratum of
composition in the <i>Rigveda</i>. Individual hymns in the earlier
books have also been proved by various recognised criteria to be of
later origin than others, and some advance has been made towards
assigning them to three or even five literary epochs. Research has,
however, not yet arrived at any certain results as to the age of whole
groups in the earlier books. For it must be borne in mind that
posteriority of collection and incorporation does not necessarily prove
a later date of composition.</p>
<p>Some hundreds of years must have been needed for all the hymns found
in the <i>Rigveda</i> to come into being. There was also, doubtless,
after the separation of the Indians from the Iranians, an intermediate
period, though it was probably of no great length. In this transitional
age must have been composed the more ancient poems which are lost, and
in which the style of the earliest preserved hymns, already composed
with much skill, was developed. The poets of the older part of the
<i>Rigveda</i> themselves mention predecessors, in whose wise they
sing, whose songs they desire to renew, and speak of ancestral hymns
produced in days of yore. As far as linguistic evidence <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>is
concerned, it affords little help in discriminating periods within the
<i>Rigveda</i> except with regard to the tenth book. For throughout the
hymns, in spite of the number of authors, essentially the same language
prevails. It is quite possible to distinguish differences of thought,
style, and poetical ability, but hardly any differences of dialect.
Nevertheless, patient and minute linguistic research, combined with the
indications derived from arrangement, metre, and subject-matter, is
beginning to yield evidence which may lead to the recognition of
chronological strata in the older books of the <i>Rigveda</i>.</p>
<p>Though the aid of MSS. for this early period entirely fails, we yet
happily possess for the <i>Rigveda</i> an abundant mass of various
readings over 2000 years old. These are contained in the other Vedas,
which are largely composed of hymns, stanzas, and lines borrowed from
the <i>Rigveda</i>. The other Vedas are, in fact, for the criticism of
the <i>Rigveda</i>, what manuscripts are for other literary monuments.
We are thus enabled to collate with the text of the <i>Rigveda</i>
directly handed down, various readings considerably older than even the
testimony of Y&#257;ska and of the Pr&#257;ti&ccedil;&#257;khyas.</p>
<p>The comparison of the various readings supplied by the later Vedas
leads to the conclusion that the text of the <i>Rigveda</i> existed,
with comparatively few exceptions, in its present form, and not in a
possibly different recension, at the time when the text of the
<i>S&#257;ma-veda</i>, the oldest form of the <i>Yajur-veda</i>, and
the <i>Atharva-veda</i> was constituted. The number of cases is
infinitesimal in which the <i>Rigveda</i> shows a corruption from which
the others are free. Thus it appears that <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb47" href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>the kernel of Vedic
tradition, as represented by the <i>Rigveda</i>, has come down to us,
with a high degree of fixity and remarkable care for verbal integrity,
from a period which can hardly be less remote than 1000 B.C.</p>
<p>It is only natural that a sacred collection of poetry, historical in
its origin, and the heritage of oral tradition before the other Vedas
were composed and the details of the later ritual practice were fixed,
should have continued to be preserved more accurately than texts formed
mainly by borrowing from it hymns which were arbitrarily cut up into
groups of verses or into single verses, solely in order to meet new
liturgical needs. For those who removed verses of the <i>Rigveda</i>
from their context and mixed them up with their own new creations would
not feel bound to guard such verses from change as strictly as those
who did nothing but continue to hand down, without any break, the
ancient text in its connected form. The control of tradition would be
wanting where quite a new tradition was being formed.</p>
<p>The criticism of the text of the <i>Rigveda</i> itself is concerned
with two periods. The first is that in which it existed alone before
the other Vedas came into being; the second is that in which it appears
in the phonetically modified form called the Sam&#803;hit&#257; text,
due to the labours of grammatical editors. Being handed down in the
older period exclusively by oral tradition, it was not preserved in
quite authentic form down to the time of its final redaction. It did
not entirely escape the fate suffered by all works which, coming down
from remote antiquity, survive into an age of changed linguistic
conditions. Though there are undeniable corruptions <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>in
detail belonging to the older period, the text maintained a remarkably
high level of authenticity till such modifications as it had undergone
reached their conclusion in the Sam&#803;hit&#257; text. This text
differs in hundreds of places from that of the composers of the hymns;
but its actual words are nearly always the same as those used by the
ancient seers. Thus there would be no uncertainty as to whether the
right word, for instance, was <i>sumnam</i> or <i>dyumnam</i>. The
difference lies almost entirely in the <i>phonetic</i> changes which
the words have undergone according to the rules of <i>Sandhi</i>
prevailing in the classical language. Thus what was formerly pronounced
as <i>tuam&#803; hi agne</i> now appears as <i>tvam&#803; hy agne</i>.
The modernisation of the text thereby produced is, however, only
partial, and is often inconsistently applied. The euphonic combinations
introduced in the Sam&#803;hit&#257; text have interfered with the
metre. Hence by reading according to the latter the older text can be
restored. At the same time the Sam&#803;hit&#257; text has preserved
the smallest minuti&aelig; of detail most liable to corruption, and the
slightest difference in the matter of accent and alternative forms,
which might have been removed with the greatest ease. Such points
furnish an additional proof that the extreme care with which the verbal
integrity of the text was guarded goes back to the earlier period
itself. Excepting single mistakes of tradition in the first, and those
due to grammatical theories in the second period, the old text of the
<i>Rigveda</i> thus shows itself to have been preserved from a very
remote antiquity with marvellous accuracy even in the smallest
details.</p>
<p>From the explanatory discussions of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as in
connection with the <i>Rigveda</i>, it results that the text
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>of the latter must have been essentially fixed in
their time, and that too in quite a special manner, more, for instance,
than the prose formulas of the <i>Yajurveda</i>. For the
<i>&Ccedil;atapatha Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>, while speaking of the
possibility of varying some of these formulas, rejects the notion of
changing the text of a certain Rigvedic verse, proposed by some
teachers, as something not to be thought of. The Br&#257;hma&#7751;as
further often mention the fact that such and such a hymn or liturgical
group contains a particular number of verses. All such numerical
statements appear to agree with the extant text of the <i>Rigveda</i>.
On the other hand, transpositions and omissions of Rigvedic verses are
to be found in the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as. These, however, are only
connected with the ritual form of those verses, and in no way show that
the text from which they were taken was different from ours.</p>
<p>The S&#363;tras also contain altered forms of Rigvedic verses, but
these are, as in the case of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as, to be explained
not from an older recension of the text, but from the necessity of
adapting them to new ritual technicalities. On the other hand, they
contain many statements which confirm our present text. Thus all that
the S&#363;tra of &Ccedil;&#257;nkh&#257;yana says about the position
occupied by verses in a hymn, or the total number of verses contained
in groups of hymns, appears invariably to agree with our text.</p>
<p>We have yet to answer the question as to when the Sam&#803;hit&#257;
text, which finally fixed the canonical form of the <i>Rigveda</i>, was
constituted. Now the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as contain a number of direct
statements as to the number of syllables in a word or a group of words,
which are at variance with the Sam&#803;hit&#257; text owing to the
vowel contractions <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50"
name="pb50">50</a>]</span>made in the latter. Moreover, the old part of
the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a literature shows hardly any traces of
speculations about phonetic questions connected with the Vedic text.
The conclusion may therefore be drawn that the Sam&#803;hit&#257; text
did not come into existence till after the completion of the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;as. With regard to the &#256;ra&#7751;yakas and
Upanishads, which form supplements to the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as, the
case is different. These works not only mention technical grammatical
terms for certain groups of letters, but contain detailed doctrines
about the phonetic treatment of the Vedic text. Here, too, occur for
the first time the names of certain theological grammarians, headed by
&Ccedil;&#257;kalya and M&#257;&#7751;&#7693;&#363;keya, who are also
recognised as authorities in the Pr&#257;ti&ccedil;&#257;khyas. The
&#256;ra&#7751;yakas and Upanishads accordingly form a transition, with
reference to the treatment of grammatical questions, between the age of
the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as and that of Y&#257;ska and the
Pr&#257;ti&ccedil;&#257;khyas. The Sam&#803;hit&#257; text must have
been created in this intermediate period, say about 600 B.C.</p>
<p>This work being completed, extraordinary precautions soon began to
be taken to guard the canonical text thus fixed against the possibility
of any change or loss. The result has been its preservation with a
faithfulness unique in literary history. The first step taken in this
direction was the constitution of the Pada, or &ldquo;word&rdquo; text,
which being an analysis of the Sam&#803;hit&#257;, gives each separate
word in its independent form, and thus to a considerable extent
restores the Sam&#803;hit&#257; text to an older stage. That the Pada
text was not quite contemporaneous in origin with the other is shown by
its containing some undoubted misinterpretations and misunderstandings.
Its composition can, however, only be separated by a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>short
interval from that of the Sam&#803;hit&#257;, for it appears to have
been known to the writer of the <i>Aitareya &#256;ra&#7751;yaka</i>,
while its author, &Ccedil;&#257;kalya, is older than both Y&#257;ska,
who quotes him, and &Ccedil;aunaka, composer of the <i>Rigveda
Pr&#257;ti&ccedil;&#257;khya</i>, which is based on the Pada text.</p>
<p>The importance of the latter as a criterion of the authenticity of
verses in the <i>Rigveda</i> is indicated by the following fact. There
are six verses in the <i>Rigveda</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1387src" href="#xd21e1387" name="xd21e1387src">1</a> not analysed
in the Pada text, but only given there over again in the
Sam&#803;hit&#257; form. This shows that &Ccedil;&#257;kalya did not
acknowledge them as truly Rigvedic, a view justified by internal
evidence. This group of six, which is doubtless exhaustive, stands
midway between old additions which &Ccedil;&#257;kalya recognised as
canonical, and the new appendages called <i>Khilas</i>, which never
gained admission into the Pada text in any form.</p>
<p>A further measure for preserving the sacred text from alteration
with still greater certainty was soon taken in the form of the
<i>Krama-p&#257;&#7789;ha</i>, or &ldquo;step-text.&rdquo; This is old,
for it, like the <i>Pada-p&#257;&#7789;ha</i>, is already known to the
author of the <i>Aitareya &#256;ra&#7751;yaka</i>. Here every word of
the Pada text occurs twice, being connected both with that which
precedes and that which follows. Thus the first four words, if
represented by <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, would be read as
<i>ab</i>, <i>bc</i>, <i>cd</i>. The
<i>Ja&#7789;&#257;-p&#257;&#7789;ha</i>, or &ldquo;woven-text,&rdquo;
in its turn based on the <i>Krama-p&#257;&#7789;ha</i>, states each of
its combinations three times, the second time in reversed order
<i>(ab</i>, <i>ba</i>, <i>ab</i>; <i>bc</i>, <i>cb</i>, <i>bc)</i>. The
climax of complication is reached in the <i>Ghana-p&#257;&#7789;ha</i>,
in which the order is <i>ab</i>, <i>ba</i>, <i>abc</i>, <i>cba</i>,
<i>abc</i>; <i>bc</i>, <i>cb</i>, <i>bcd</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The Pr&#257;ti&ccedil;&#257;khyas may also be regarded as safeguards
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=
"pb52">52</a>]</span>of the text, having been composed for the purpose
of exhibiting exactly all the changes necessary for turning the Pada
into the Sam&#803;hit&#257; text.</p>
<p>Finally, the class of supplementary works called
Anukrama&#7751;&#299;s, or &ldquo;Indices&rdquo; aimed at preserving
the <i>Rigveda</i> intact by registering its contents from various
points of view, besides furnishing calculations of the number of hymns,
verses, words, and even syllables, contained in the sacred book.</p>
<p>The text of the <i>Rigveda</i> has come down to us in a single
recension only; but is there any evidence that other recensions of it
existed in former times?</p>
<p>The <i>Chara&#7751;a-vy&#363;ha</i>, or &ldquo;Exposition of
Schools,&rdquo; a supplementary work of the S&#363;tra period, mentions
as the five <i>&ccedil;&#257;kh&#257;s</i> or &ldquo;branches&rdquo; of
the <i>Rigveda</i>, the &Ccedil;&#257;kalas, the V&#257;shkalas, the
&#256;&ccedil;val&#257;yanas, the &Ccedil;&#257;nkh&#257;yanas, and the
M&#257;&#7751;&#7693;&#363;keyas. The third and fourth of these
schools, however, do not represent different recensions of the text,
the sole distinction between them and the &Ccedil;&#257;kalas having
been that the &#256;&ccedil;val&#257;yanas recognised as canonical the
group of the eleven <i>V&#257;lakhilya</i> or supplementary hymns, and
the &Ccedil;&#257;nkh&#257;yanas admitted the same group, diminished
only by a few verses. Hence the tradition of the Pur&#257;&#7751;as, or
later legendary works, mentions only the three schools of
&Ccedil;&#257;kalas, V&#257;shkalas, and
M&#257;&#7751;&#7693;&#363;kas. If the latter ever possessed a
recension of an independent character, all traces of it were lost at an
early period in ancient India, for no information of any kind about it
has been preserved. Thus only the two schools of the
&Ccedil;&#257;kalas and the V&#257;shkalas come into consideration. The
subsidiary Vedic writings contain sufficient evidence to show that the
text of the V&#257;shkalas differed from that of the
&Ccedil;&#257;kalas only in admitting eight additional hymns, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>in assigning another position to a group of the
first book. But in these respects it compares unfavourably with the
extant text. Thus it is evident that the &Ccedil;&#257;kalas not only
possessed the best tradition of the text of the <i>Rigveda</i>, but
handed down the only recension, in the true sense, which, as far as we
can tell, ever existed.</p>
<p>The text of the <i>Rigveda</i>, like that of the other
Sam&#803;hit&#257;s, as well as of two of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as (the
<i>&Ccedil;atapatha</i> and the <i>Taittir&#299;ya</i>, together with
its &#256;ra&#7751;yaka), has come down to us in an accented form. The
peculiarly sacred character of the text rendered the accent very
important for correct and efficacious recitation. Analogously the
accent was marked by the Greeks in learned and model editions only. The
nature of the Vedic accent was musical, depending on the pitch of the
voice, like that of the ancient Greeks. This remained the character of
the Sanskrit accent till later than the time of P&#257;&#7751;ini. But
just as the old Greek musical accent, after the beginning of our era,
was transformed into a stress accent, so by the seventh century A.D.
(and probably long before) the Sanskrit accent had undergone a similar
change. While, however, in modern Greek the stress accent has remained,
owing to the high pitch of the old acute, on the same syllable as bore
the musical accent in the ancient language, the modern pronunciation of
Sanskrit has no connection with the Vedic accent, but is dependent on
the quantity of the last two or three syllables, much the same as in
Latin. Thus the penultimate, if long, is accented, <i>e.g.</i>
<i>K&#257;lid&#257;&#769;sa</i>, or the antepenultimate, if long and
followed by a short syllable, <i>e.g.</i>
<i>br&#257;&#769;hma&#7751;a</i> or <i>Him&#257;&#769;laya</i>
(&ldquo;abode of snow&rdquo;). This change of accent in Sanskrit was
brought about by the influence of Pr&#257;krit, in which, as there is
evidence to show, the stress accent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54"
href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>is very old, going back several
centuries before the beginning of our era.</p>
<p>There are three accents in the <i>Rigveda</i> as well as the other
sacred texts. The most important of these is the rising accent, called
<i>ud-&#257;tta</i> (&ldquo;raised&rdquo;), which corresponds to the
Greek acute. Comparative philology shows that in Sanskrit it rests on
the same syllable as bore it in the proto-Aryan language. In Greek it
is generally on the same syllable as in Sanskrit, except when
interfered with by the specifically Greek law restricting the accent to
one of the last three syllables. Thus the Greek <i>hept&aacute;</i>
corresponds to the Vedic <i>sapt&aacute;</i>, &ldquo;seven.&rdquo; The
low-pitch accent, which precedes the acute, is called the
<i>anud&#257;tta</i> (&ldquo;not raised&rdquo;). The third is the
falling accent, which usually follows the acute, and is called
<i>svarita</i> (&ldquo;sounded&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Of the four different systems of marking the accent in Vedic texts,
that of the <i>Rigveda</i> is most commonly employed. Here the acute is
not marked at all, while the low-pitch <i>anud&#257;tta</i> is
indicated by a horizontal stroke below the syllable bearing it, and the
<i>svarita</i> by a vertical stroke above. Thus
<i>y&#257;jnasy&agrave;</i> (&ldquo;of sacrifice&rdquo;) would mean
that the second syllable has the acute and the third the <i>svarita</i>
(<i>yajn&aacute;sy&agrave;</i>). The reason why the acute is not marked
is because it is regarded as the middle tone between the other
two.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1586src" href="#xd21e1586" name=
"xd21e1586src">2</a></p>
<p>The hymns of the <i>Rigveda</i> consist of stanzas ranging in number
from three to fifty-eight, but usually not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>exceeding ten or twelve. These stanzas (often
loosely called verses) are composed in some fifteen different metres,
only seven of which, however, are at all frequent. Three of them are by
far the commonest, claiming together about four-fifths of the total
number of stanzas in the <i>Rigveda</i>.</p>
<p>There is an essential difference between Greek and Vedic prosody.
Whereas the metrical unit of the former system is the foot, in the
latter it is the line (or verse), feet not being distinguished.
Curiously enough, however, the Vedic metrical unit is also called
<i>p&#257;da</i>, or &ldquo;foot,&rdquo; but for a very different
reason; for the word has here really the figurative sense of
&ldquo;quarter&rdquo; (from the foot of a quadruped), Because the most
usual kind of stanza has four lines. The ordinary <i>p&#257;das</i>
consist of eight, eleven, or twelve syllables. A stanza or
<i>&#7771;ich</i> is generally formed of three or four lines of the
same kind. Four or five of the rarer types of stanza are, however, made
up of a combination of different lines.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that the Vedic metres have a certain elasticity to
which we are unaccustomed in Greek prosody, and which recalls the
irregularities of the Latin Saturnian verse. Only the rhythm of the
last four or five syllables is determined, the first part of the line
not being subject to rule. Regarded in their historical connection, the
Vedic metres, which are the foundation of the entire prosody of the
later literature, occupy a position midway between the system of the
Indo-Iranian period and that of classical Sanskrit. For the evidence of
the Avesta, with its eight and eleven syllable lines, which ignore
quantity, but are combined into stanzas otherwise the same as those of
the <i>Rigveda</i>, indicates that the metrical practice of the period
when Persians <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span>and Indians were still one people, depended on no
other principle than the counting of syllables. In the Sanskrit period,
on the other hand, the quantity of every syllable in the line was
determined in all metres, with the sole exception of the loose measure
(called <i>&ccedil;loka</i>) employed in epic poetry. The metrical
regulation of the line, starting from its end, thus finally extended to
the whole. The fixed rhythm at the end of the Vedic line is called
<i>v&#7771;itta</i>, literally &ldquo;turn&rdquo; (from
<i>v&#7771;it</i>, Lat. <i>vert-ere</i>), which corresponds
etymologically to the Latin <i>versus</i>.</p>
<p>The eight-syllable line usually ends in two iambics, the first four
syllables, though not exactly determined, having a tendency to be
iambic also. This verse is therefore the almost exact equivalent of the
Greek iambic dimeter.</p>
<p>Three of these lines combine to form the <i>g&#257;yatr&#299;</i>
metre, in which nearly one-fourth (2450) of the total number of stanzas
in the <i>Rigveda</i> is composed. An example of it is the first stanza
of the <i>Rigveda</i>, which runs as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">Agn&iacute;m &#299;le pur&oacute;hitam&#803;</p>
<p class="line">Yajn&aacute;sya dev&aacute;m
&#7771;itv&iacute;jam&#803;</p>
<p class="line">H&oacute;t&#257;ram&#803; ratnadh&#257;&#769;tamam.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">It may be closely rendered thus in lines imitating the
rhythm of the original:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">I praise Agni, domestic priest,</p>
<p class="line">God, minister of sacrifice,</p>
<p class="line">Herald, most prodigal of wealth.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Four of these eight-syllable lines combine to form the
<i>anush&#7789;ubh</i> stanza, in which the first two and the last two
are more closely connected. In the <i>Rigveda</i> the number of stanzas
in this measure amounts to only <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57"
href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>about one-third of those in the
<i>g&#257;yatr&#299;</i>. This relation is gradually reversed, till we
reach the post-Vedic period, when the <i>g&#257;yatr&#299;</i> is found
to have disappeared, and the <i>anush&#7789;ubh</i> (now generally
called <i>&ccedil;loka</i>) to have become the predominant measure of
Sanskrit poetry. A development in the character of this metre may be
observed within the <i>Rigveda</i> itself. All its verses in the oldest
hymns are the same, being iambic in rhythm. In later hymns, however, a
tendency to differentiate the first and third from the second and
fourth lines, by making the former non-iambic, begins to show itself.
Finally, in the latest hymns of the tenth book the prevalence of the
iambic rhythm disappears in the odd lines. Here every possible
combination of quantity in the last four syllables is found, but the
commonest variation, nearly equalling the iambic in frequency, is
[short][long][long][shortlong]. The latter is the regular ending of the
first and third line in the post-Vedic <i>&ccedil;loka</i>.</p>
<p>The twelve-syllable line ends thus:
[long][short][long][short][short]. Four of these together form the
<i>jagat&#299;</i> stanza. The <i>trish&#7789;ubh</i> stanza consists
of four lines of eleven syllables, which are practically catalectic
<i>jagat&#299;s</i>, as they end [long][short][long][shortlong]. These
two verses being so closely allied and having the same cadence, are
often found mixed in the same stanza. The <i>trish&#7789;ubh</i> is by
far the commonest metre, about two-fifths of the <i>Rigveda</i> being
composed in it.</p>
<p>Speaking generally, a hymn of the <i>Rigveda</i> consists entirely
of stanzas in the same metre. The regular and typical deviation from
this rule is to conclude a hymn with a single stanza in a metre
different from that of the rest, this being a natural method of
distinctly marking its close.</p>
<p>A certain number of hymns of the <i>Rigveda</i> consist <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>not
merely of a succession of single stanzas, but of equal groups of
stanzas. The group consists either of three stanzas in the same simple
metre, generally <i>g&#257;yatr&#299;</i>, or of the combination of two
stanzas in different mixed metres. The latter strophic type goes by the
name of <i>Prag&#257;tha</i>, and is found chiefly in the eighth book
of the <i>Rigveda</i>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59"

<h2 class="main">Poetry of the Rigveda</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Before we turn to describe the world of thought
revealed in the hymns of the <i>Rigveda</i>, the question may naturally
be asked, to what extent is it possible to understand the true meaning
of a book occupying so isolated a position in the remotest age of
Indian literature? The answer to this question depends on the
recognition of the right method of interpretation applicable to that
ancient body of poetry. When the <i>Rigveda</i> first became known,
European scholars, as yet only acquainted with the language and
literature of classical Sanskrit, found that the Vedic hymns were
composed in an ancient dialect and embodied a world of ideas far
removed from that with which they had made themselves familiar. The
interpretation of these hymns was therefore at the outset barred by
almost insurmountable difficulties. Fortunately, however, a voluminous
commentary on the <i>Rigveda</i>, which explains or paraphrases every
word of its hymns, was found to exist. This was the work of the great
Vedic scholar <span class="sc">S&#257;ya&#7751;a</span>, who lived in
the latter half of the fourteenth century A.D. at Vijayanagara
(&ldquo;City of Victory&rdquo;), the ruins of which lie near Bellary in
Southern India. As his commentary constantly referred to ancient
authorities, it was thought to have preserved the true meaning of the
<i>Rigveda</i> in a traditional interpretation <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>going
back to the most ancient times. Nothing further seemed to be necessary
than to ascertain the explanation of the original text which prevailed
in India five centuries ago, and is laid down in
S&#257;ya&#7751;a&rsquo;s work. This view is represented by the
translation of the <i>Rigveda</i> begun in 1850 by H. H. Wilson, the
first professor of Sanskrit at Oxford.</p>
<p>Another line was taken by the late Professor Roth, the founder of
Vedic philology. This great scholar propounded the view that the aim of
Vedic interpretation was not to ascertain the meaning which
S&#257;ya&#7751;a, or even <span class="sc">Y&#257;ska</span>, who
lived eighteen centuries earlier, attributed to the Vedic hymns, but
the meaning which the ancient poets themselves intended. Such an end
could not be attained by simply following the lead of the commentators.
For the latter, though valuable guides towards the understanding of the
later theological and ritual literature, with the notions and practice
of which they were familiar, showed no continuity of tradition from the
time of the poets; for the tradition supplied by them was solely that
which was handed down among interpreters, and only began when the
meaning of the hymns was no longer fully comprehended. There could, in
fact, be no other tradition; interpretation only arising when the hymns
had become obscure. The commentators, therefore, simply preserved
attempts at the solution of difficulties, while showing a distinct
tendency towards misinterpreting the language as well as the religious,
mythological, and cosmical ideas of a vanished age by the scholastic
notions prevalent in their own.</p>
<p>It is clear from what Y&#257;ska says that some important
discrepancies in opinion prevailed among the older expositors
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span>and the different schools of interpretation which
flourished before his time. He gives the names of no fewer than
seventeen predecessors, whose explanations of the Veda are often
conflicting. Thus one of them interprets the word <i>N&#257;satyau</i>,
an epithet of the Vedic Dioskouroi, as &ldquo;true, not false;&rdquo;
another takes it to mean &ldquo;leaders of truth,&rdquo; while
Y&#257;ska himself thinks it might mean &ldquo;nose-born&rdquo;! The
gap between the poets and the early interpreters was indeed so great
that one of Y&#257;ska&rsquo;s predecessors, named Kautsa, actually had
the audacity to assert that the science of Vedic exposition was
useless, as the Vedic hymns and formulas were obscure, unmeaning, or
mutually contradictory. Such criticisms Y&#257;ska meets by replying
that it was not the fault of the rafter if the blind man did not see
it. Y&#257;ska himself interprets only a very small portion of the
hymns of the <i>Rigveda</i>. In what he does attempt to explain, he
largely depends on etymological considerations for the sense he
assigns. He often gives two or more alternative or optional senses to
the same word. The fact that he offers a choice of meanings shows that
he had no earlier authority for his guide, and that his renderings are
simply conjectural; for no one can suppose that the authors of the
hymns had more than one meaning in their minds.</p>
<p>It is, however, highly probable that Y&#257;ska, with all the
appliances at his command, was able to ascertain the sense of many
words which scholars who, like S&#257;ya&#7751;a, lived nearly two
thousand years later, had no means of discovering. Nevertheless
S&#257;ya&#7751;a is sometimes found to depart from Y&#257;ska. Thus we
arrive at the dilemma that either the old interpreter is wrong or the
later one does not follow the tradition. There are also many instances
in which S&#257;ya&#7751;a, independently of Y&#257;ska, gives
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>a variety of inconsistent explanations of a word,
both in interpreting a single passage or in commenting on different
passages. Thus <i>&ccedil;&#257;rada</i>, &ldquo;autumnal,&rdquo; he
explains in one place as &ldquo;fortified for a year,&rdquo; in another
as &ldquo;new or fortified for a year,&rdquo; and in a third as
&ldquo;belonging to a demon called &Ccedil;arad.&rdquo; One of the
defects of S&#257;ya&#7751;a is, in fact, that he limits his view in
most cases to the single verse he has before him. A detailed
examination of his explanations, as well as those of Y&#257;ska, has
shown that there is in the <i>Rigveda</i> a large number of the most
difficult words, about the proper sense of which neither scholar had
any certain information from either tradition or etymology. We are
therefore justified in saying about them that there is in the hymns no
unusual or difficult word or obscure text in regard to which the
authority of the commentators should be received as final, unless it is
supported by probability, by the context, or by parallel passages. Thus
no translation of the <i>Rigveda</i> based exclusively on
S&#257;ya&#7751;a&rsquo;s commentary can possibly be satisfactory. It
would, in fact, be as unreasonable to take him for our sole guide as to
make our understanding of the Hebrew books of the Old Testament
dependent on the Talmud and the Rabbis. It must, indeed, be admitted
that from a large proportion of S&#257;ya&#7751;a&rsquo;s
interpretations most material help can be derived, and that he has been
of the greatest service in facilitating and accelerating the
comprehension of the Veda. But there is little information of value to
be derived from him, that, with our knowledge of later Sanskrit, with
the other remains of ancient Indian literature, and with our various
philological appliances, we might not sooner or later have found out
for ourselves. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span></p>
<p>Roth, then, rejected the commentators as our chief guides in
interpreting the <i>Rigveda</i>, which, as the earliest literary
monument of the Indian, and indeed of the Aryan race, stands quite by
itself, high up on an isolated peak of remote antiquity. As regards its
more peculiar and difficult portions, it must therefore be interpreted
mainly through itself; or, to apply in another sense the words of an
Indian commentator, it must shine by its own light and be
self-demonstrating. Roth further expressed the view that a qualified
European is better able to arrive at the true meaning of the
<i>Rigveda</i> than a Brahman interpreter. The judgment of the former
is unfettered by theological bias; he possesses the historical faculty,
and he has also a far wider intellectual horizon, equipped as he is
with all the resources of scientific scholarship. Roth therefore set
himself to compare carefully all passages parallel in form and matter,
with due regard to considerations of context, grammar, and etymology,
while consulting, though, perhaps, with insufficient attention, the
traditional interpretations. He thus subjected the <i>Rigveda</i> to a
historical treatment within the range of Sanskrit itself. He further
called in the assistance rendered from without by the comparative
method, utilising the help afforded not only by the <i>Avesta</i>,
which is so closely allied to the <i>Rigveda</i> in language and
matter, but also by the results of comparative philology, resources
unknown to the traditional scholar.</p>
<p>By thus ascertaining the meaning of single words, the foundations of
the scientific interpretation of the Vedas were laid in the great
Sanskrit Dictionary, in seven volumes, published by Roth in
collaboration with B&ouml;htlingk between 1852 and 1875. Roth&rsquo;s
method is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span>now accepted by every scientific student of the
Veda. Native tradition is, however, being more fully exploited than was
done by Roth himself, for it is now more clearly recognised that no aid
to be derived from extant Indian scholarship ought to be neglected.
Under the guidance of such principles the progress already made in
solving many important problems presented by Vedic literature has been
surprising, when we consider the shortness of the time and the fewness
of the labourers, of whom only two or three have been natives of this
country. As a general result, the historical sense has succeeded in
grasping the spirit of Indian antiquity, long obscured by native
misinterpretation. Much, of course, still remains to be done by future
generations of scholars, especially in detailed and minute
investigation. This could not be otherwise when we remember that Vedic
research is only the product of the last fifty years, and that,
notwithstanding the labours of very numerous Hebrew scholars during
several centuries, there are, in the Psalms and the Prophetic Books of
the Old Testament, still many passages which remain obscure and
disputed. There can be no doubt that many problems at present insoluble
will in the end be solved by that modern scholarship which has already
deciphered the cuneiform writings of Persia as well as the rock
inscriptions of India, and has discovered the languages which lay
hidden under these mysterious characters.</p>
<p>Having thus arrived at the threshold of the world of Vedic thought,
we may now enter through the portals opened by the golden key of
scholarship. By far the greater part of the poetry of the
<i>Rigveda</i> consists of religious lyrics, only the tenth book
containing some secular poems. Its hymns are mainly addressed to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=
"pb65">65</a>]</span>various gods of the Vedic pantheon, praising their
mighty deeds, their greatness, and their beneficence, or beseeching
them for wealth in cattle, numerous offspring, prosperity, long life,
and victory. The <i>Rigveda</i> is not a collection of primitive
popular poetry, as it was apt to be described at an earlier period of
Sanskrit studies. It is rather a body of skilfully composed hymns,
produced by a sacerdotal class and meant to accompany the Soma oblation
and the fire sacrifice of melted butter, which were offered according
to a ritual by no means so simple as was at one time supposed, though
undoubtedly much simpler than the elaborate system of the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a period. Its poetry is consequently marred by
frequent references to the sacrifice, especially when the two great
ritual deities, Agni and Soma, are the objects of praise. At the same
time it is on the whole much more natural than might under these
conditions be expected. For the gods who are invoked are nearly all
personifications of the phenomena of Nature, and thus give occasion for
the employment of much beautiful and even noble imagery. The diction of
the hymns is, generally speaking, simple and unaffected. Compound words
are sparingly used, and are limited to two members, in marked contrast
with the frequency and length of compounds in classical Sanskrit. The
thought, too, is usually artless and direct, except in the hymns to the
ritual deities, where it becomes involved in conceit and mystical
obscurity. The very limited nature of the theme, in these cases, must
have forced the minds of the priestly singers to strive after variety
by giving utterance to the same idea in enigmatical phraseology.</p>
<p>Here, then, we already find the beginnings of that fondness for
subtlety and difficult modes of expression <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>which is
so prevalent in the later literature, and which is betrayed even in the
earlier period by the saying in one of the Br&#257;hmanas that the gods
love the recondite. In some hymns, too, there appears that tendency to
play with words which was carried to inordinate lengths in late
Sanskrit poems and romances. The hymns of the <i>Rigveda</i>, of
course, vary much in literary merit, as is naturally to be expected in
the productions of many poets extending over some centuries. Many
display a high order of poetical excellence, while others consist of
commonplace and mechanical verse. The degree of skill in composition is
on the average remarkably high, especially when we consider that here
we have by far the oldest poetry of the Aryan race. The art which these
early seers feel is needed to produce a hymn acceptable to the gods is
often alluded to, generally in the closing stanza. The poet usually
compares his work to a car wrought and put together by a deft
craftsman. One Rishi also likens his prayers to fair and well-woven
garments; another speaks of having adorned his song of praise like a
bride for her lover. Poets laud the gods according to knowledge and
ability (vi. 21, 6), and give utterance to the emotions of their hearts
(x. 39, 15). Various individual gods are, it is true, in a general way
said to have granted seers the gift of song, but of the later doctrine
of revelation the Rigvedic poets know nothing.</p>
<p>The remark which has often been made that monotony prevails in the
Vedic hymns contains truth. But the impression is produced by the hymns
to the same deity being commonly grouped together in each book. A
similar effect would probably arise from reading in succession twenty
or thirty lyrics on Spring, even in an anthology of the best modern
poetry. When we consider <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href=
"#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span>that nearly five hundred hymns of the
<i>Rigveda</i> are addressed to two deities alone, it is surprising
that so many variations of the same theme should be possible.</p>
<p>The hymns of the <i>Rigveda</i> being mainly invocations of the
gods, their contents are largely mythological. Special interest
attaches to this mythology, because it represents an earlier stage of
thought than is to be found in any other literature. It is sufficiently
primitive to enable us to see clearly the process of personification by
which natural phenomena developed into gods. Never observing, in his
ordinary life, action or movement not caused by an acting or moving
person, the Vedic Indian, like man in a much less advanced state, still
refers such occurrences in Nature to personal agents, which to him are
inherent in the phenomena. He still looks out upon the workings of
Nature with childlike astonishment. One poet asks why the sun does not
fall from the sky; another wonders where the stars go by day; while a
third marvels that the waters of all rivers constantly flowing into it
never fill the ocean. The unvarying regularity of sun and moon, and the
unfailing recurrence of the dawn, however, suggested to these ancient
singers the idea of the unchanging order that prevails in Nature. The
notion of this general law, recognised under the name <i>&#7771;ita</i>
(properly the &ldquo;course&rdquo; of things), we find in the
<i>Rigveda</i> extended first to the fixed rules of the sacrifice
(rite), and then to those of morality (right). Though the mythological
phase presented by the <i>Rigveda</i> is comparatively primitive, it
yet contains many conceptions inherited from previous ages. The
parallels of the <i>Avesta</i> show that several of the Vedic deities
go back to the time when the ancestors of Persians and Indians were
still one people. Among these may be mentioned <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>Yama,
god of the dead, identical with Yima, ruler of paradise, and especially
Mitra, the cult of whose Persian counterpart, Mithra, obtained from
200&ndash;400 A.D. a world-wide diffusion in the Roman Empire, and came
nearer to monotheism than the cult of any other god in paganism.</p>
<p>Various religious practices can also be traced back to that early
age, such as the worship of fire and the cult of the plant <i>Soma</i>
(the Avestan <i>Haoma</i>). The veneration of the cow, too, dates from
that time. A religious hymn poetry must have existed even then, for
stanzas of four eleven-syllable (the Vedic <i>trish&#7789;ubh</i>) and
of four or three eight-syllable lines (<i>anush&#7789;ubh</i> and
<i>g&#257;yatr&#299;</i>) were already known, as is proved by the
agreement of the <i>Avesta</i> with the <i>Rigveda</i>.</p>
<p>From the still earlier Indo-European period had come down the
general conception of &ldquo;god&rdquo; (<i>deva-s</i>, Lat.
<i>deu-s</i>) and that of heaven as a divine father (<i>Dyau&#7779;
pit&#257;</i>, Gr. <i>Zeus pat&#275;r</i>, Lat. <i>J&#363;piter</i>).
Probably from an even remoter antiquity is derived the notion of heaven
and earth as primeval and universal parents, as well as many magical
beliefs.</p>
<p>The universe appeared to the poets of the <i>Rigveda</i> to be
divided into the three domains of earth, air, and heaven, a division
perhaps also known to the early Greeks. This is the favourite triad of
the <i>Rigveda</i>, constantly mentioned expressly or by implication.
The solar phenomena are referred to heaven, while those of lightning,
rain, and wind belong to the air. In the three worlds the various gods
perform their actions, though they are supposed to dwell only in the
third, the home of light. The air is often called a sea, as the abode
of the celestial waters, while the great rainless clouds are conceived
sometimes as rocks or mountains, sometimes as the castles of demons who
war against the gods. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href=
"#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>thundering rain-clouds become lowing
cows, whose milk is shed and bestows fatness upon the earth.</p>
<p>The higher gods of the <i>Rigveda</i> are almost entirely
personifications of natural phenomena, such as Sun, Dawn, Fire, Wind.
Excepting a few deities surviving from an older period, the gods are,
for the most part, more or less clearly connected with their physical
foundation. The personifications being therefore but slightly
developed, lack definiteness of outline and individuality of character.
Moreover, the phenomena themselves which are behind the
personifications have few distinctive traits, while they share some
attributes with other phenomena belonging to the same domain. Thus
Dawn, Sun, Fire have the common features of being luminous, dispelling
darkness, appearing in the morning. Hence the character of each god is
made up of only a few essential qualities combined with many others
which are common to all the gods, such as brilliance, power,
beneficence, and wisdom. These common attributes tend to obscure those
which are distinctive, because in hymns of prayer and praise the former
naturally assume special importance. Again, gods belonging to different
departments of nature, but having striking features in common, are apt
to grow more like each other. Assimilation of this kind is encouraged
by a peculiar practice of the Vedic poets&mdash;the invocation of
deities in pairs. Such combinations result in attributes peculiar to
the one god attaching themselves to the other, even when the latter
appears alone. Thus when the Fire-god, invoked by himself, is called a
slayer of the demon V&#7771;itra, he receives an attribute distinctive
of the thunder-god Indra, with whom he is often coupled. The
possibility of assigning nearly every power to every god rendered the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>identification of one deity with another an easy
matter. Such identifications are frequent enough in the <i>Rigveda</i>.
For example, a poet addressing the fire-god exclaims: &ldquo;Thou at
thy birth, O Agni, art Varu&#7751;a; when kindled thou becomest Mitra;
in thee, O Son of Might, all gods are centred; thou art Indra to the
worshipper&rdquo; (v. 3, 1).</p>
<p>Moreover, mystical speculations on the nature of Agni, so important
a god in the eyes of a priesthood devoted to a fire-cult, on his many
manifestations as individual fires on earth, and on his other aspects
as atmospheric fire in lightning and as celestial fire in the
sun&mdash;aspects which the Vedic poets are fond of alluding to in
riddles&mdash;would suggest the idea that various deities are but
different forms of a single divine being. This idea is found in more
than one passage of the later hymns of the <i>Rigveda</i>. Thus the
composer of a recent hymn (164) of the first book says: &ldquo;The one
being priests speak of in many ways; they call it Agni, Yama,
M&#257;tari&ccedil;van.&rdquo; Similarly, a seer of the last book (x.
114) remarks: &ldquo;Priests and poets with words make into many the
bird (<i>i.e.</i> the sun) which is but one.&rdquo; Utterances like
these show that by the end of the Rigvedic period the polytheism of the
Rishis had received a monotheistic tinge.</p>
<p>Occasionally we even find shadowed forth the pantheistic idea of a
deity representing not only all the gods, but Nature as well. Thus the
goddess Aditi is identified with all the deities, with men, with all
that has been and shall be born, with air, and heaven (i. 89); and in a
cosmogonic hymn (x. 121) the Creator is not only described as the one
god above all gods, but is said<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1941src"
href="#xd21e1941" name="xd21e1941src">1</a> to embrace all things. This
germ of pantheism developed through the later Vedic literature till it
assumed its final shape in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71"
href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>Ved&#257;nta philosophy, still
the most popular system of the Hindus.</p>
<p>The practice of the poets, even in the older parts of the
<i>Rigveda</i>, of invoking different gods as if each of them were
paramount, gave rise to Professor Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s theory of
Henotheism or Kathenotheism, according to which the seers held
&ldquo;the belief in individual gods alternately regarded as the
highest,&rdquo; and for the moment treated the god addressed as if he
were an absolutely independent and supreme deity, alone present to the
mind. In reality, however, the practice of the poets of the
<i>Rigveda</i> hardly amounts to more than the exaggeration&mdash;to be
found in the Homeric hymns also&mdash;with which a singer would
naturally magnify the particular god whom he is invoking. For the
Rishis well knew the exact position of each god in the Soma ritual, in
which nearly every member of the pantheon found a place.</p>
<p>The gods, in the view of the Vedic poets, had a beginning; for they
are described as the offspring of heaven and earth, or sometimes of
other gods. This in itself implies different generations, but earlier
gods are also expressly referred to in several passages. Nor were the
gods regarded as originally immortal; for immortality is said to have
been bestowed upon them by individual deities, such as Agni and
Savit&#7771;i, or to have been acquired by drinking soma. Indra and
other gods are spoken of as unaging, but whether their immortality was
regarded by the poets as absolute there is no evidence to show. In the
post-Vedic view it was only relative, being limited to a cosmic
age.</p>
<p>The physical aspect of the Vedic gods is anthropomorphic. Thus head,
face, eyes, arms, hands, feet, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72"
href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>and other portions of the human
frame are ascribed to them. But their forms are shadowy and their limbs
or parts are often simply meant figuratively to describe their
activities. Thus the tongue and limbs of the fire-god are merely his
flames; the arms of the sun-god are simply his rays, while his eye only
represents the solar orb. Since the outward shape of the gods was thus
vaguely conceived, while their connection with natural phenomena was in
many instances still evident, it is easy to understand why no mention
is made in the <i>Rigveda</i> of images of the gods, still less of
temples, which imply the existence of images. Idols first begin to be
referred to in the S&#363;tras.</p>
<p>Some of the gods appear equipped as warriors, wearing coats of mail
and helmets, and armed with spears, battle-axes, bows and arrows. They
all drive through the air in luminous cars, generally drawn by horses,
but in some cases by kine, goats, or deer. In their cars the gods come
to seat themselves at the sacrifice, which, however, is also conveyed
to them in heaven by Agni. They are on the whole conceived as dwelling
together in harmony; the only one who ever introduces a note of discord
being the warlike and overbearing Indra.</p>
<p>To the successful and therefore optimistic Vedic Indian, the gods
seemed almost exclusively beneficent beings, bestowers of long life and
prosperity. Indeed, the only deity in whom injurious features are at
all prominent is Rudra. The lesser evils closely connected with human
life, such as disease, proceed from minor demons, while the greater
evils manifested in Nature, such as drought and darkness, are produced
by powerful demons like V&#7771;itra. The conquest of these demons
brings out all the more strikingly the beneficent nature of the gods.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span></p>
<p>The character of the Vedic gods is also moral. They are
&ldquo;true&rdquo; and &ldquo;not deceitful,&rdquo; being throughout
the friends and guardians of honesty and virtue. But the divine
morality only reflects the ethical standard of an early civilisation.
Thus even the alliance of Varu&#7751;a, the most moral of the gods,
with righteousness is not such as to prevent him from employing craft
against the hostile and the deceitful man. Moral elevation is, on the
whole, a less prominent characteristic of the gods than greatness and
power.</p>
<p>The relation of the worshipper to the gods in the <i>Rigveda</i> is
in general one of dependence on their will, prayers and sacrifices
being offered to win their favour or forgiveness. The expectation of
something in return for the offering is, however, frequently apparent,
and the keynote of many a hymn is, &ldquo;I give to thee that thou
mayst give to me.&rdquo; The idea is also often expressed that the
might and valour of the gods is produced by hymns, sacrifices, and
especially offerings of soma. Here we find the germs of sacerdotal
pretensions which gradually increased during the Vedic age. Thus the
statement occurs in the <i>White Yajurveda</i> that the Brahman who
possesses correct knowledge has the gods in his power. The
Br&#257;hma&#7751;as go a step farther in saying that there are two
kinds of gods, the Devas and the Brahmans, the latter of whom are to be
held as deities among men. In the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as, too, the
sacrifice is represented as all-powerful, controlling not only the
gods, but the very processes of nature.</p>
<p>The number of the gods is stated in the <i>Rigveda</i> itself to be
thirty-three, several times expressed as thrice eleven, when each group
is regarded as corresponding <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href=
"#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>to one of the divisions of the
threefold universe. This aggregate could not always have been deemed
exhaustive, for sometimes other gods are mentioned in addition to the
thirty-three. Nor can this number, of course, include various groups,
such as the storm-gods.</p>
<p>There are, however, hardly twenty individual deities important
enough in the <i>Rigveda</i> to have at least three entire hymns
addressed to them. The most prominent of these are Indra, the
thunder-god, with at least 250 hymns, Agni with about 200, and Soma
with over 100; while Parjanya, god of rain, and Yama, god of the dead,
are invoked in only three each. The rest occupy various positions
between these two extremes. It is somewhat remarkable that the two
great deities of modern Hinduism, Vish&#7751;u and &Ccedil;iva, who are
equal in importance, should have been on the same level, though far
below the leading deities, three thousand years ago, as Vish&#7751;u
and Rudra (the earlier form of &Ccedil;iva) in the <i>Rigveda</i>. Even
then they show the same general characteristics as now, Vish&#7751;u
being specially benevolent and Rudra terrible.</p>
<p>The oldest among the gods of heaven is Dyaus (identical with the
Greek Zeus). This personification of the sky as a god never went beyond
a rudimentary stage in the <i>Rigveda</i>, being almost entirely
limited to the idea of paternity. Dyaus is generally coupled with
P&#7771;ithiv&#299;, Earth, the pair being celebrated in six hymns as
universal parents. In a few passages Dyaus is called a bull, ruddy and
bellowing downwards, with reference to the fertilising power of rain no
less than to the lightning and thundering heavens. He is also once
compared with a black steed decked with pearls, in obvious allusion to
the nocturnal star-spangled sky. One poet describes this god
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>as furnished with a bolt, while another speaks of
him as &ldquo;Dyaus smiling through the clouds,&rdquo; meaning the
lightening sky. In several other passages of the <i>Rigveda</i> the
verb &ldquo;to smile&rdquo; (<i>smi</i>) alludes to lightning, just as
in classical Sanskrit a smile is constantly compared with objects of
dazzling whiteness.</p>
<p>A much more important deity of the sky is Varu&#7751;a, in whom the
personification has proceeded so far that the natural phenomenon which
underlies it can only be inferred from traits in his character. This
obscurity of origin arises partly from his not being a creation of
Indian mythology, but a heritage from an earlier age, and partly from
his name not at the same time designating a natural phenomenon, like
that of Dyaus. The word <i>varu&#7751;a-s</i> seems to have originally
meant the &ldquo;encompassing&rdquo; sky, and is probably the same word
as the Greek <i>Ouranos</i>, though the identification presents some
phonetic difficulties. Varu&#7751;a is invoked in far fewer hymns than
Indra, Agni, or Soma, but he is undoubtedly the greatest of the Vedic
gods by the side of Indra. While Indra is the great warrior,
Varu&#7751;a is the great upholder of physical and moral order
(<i>&#7771;ita</i>). The hymns addressed to him are more ethical and
devout in tone than any others. They form the most exalted portion of
the Veda, often resembling in character the Hebrew psalms. The peaceful
sway of Varu&#7751;a is explained by his connection with the regularly
recurring celestial phenomena, the course of the heavenly bodies seen
in the sky; Indra&rsquo;s warlike and occasionally capricious nature is
accounted for by the variable and uncertain strife of the elements in
the thunderstorm. The character and power of Varu&#7751;a may be
sketched as nearly as possible in the words of the Vedic poets
themselves as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>follows. By the law of Varu&#7751;a heaven and
earth are held apart. He made the golden swing (the sun) to shine in
heaven. He has made a wide path for the sun. The wind which resounds
through the air is Varu&#7751;a&rsquo;s breath. By his ordinances the
moon shining brightly moves at night, and the stars placed up on high
are seen at night but disappear by day. He causes the rivers to flow;
they stream unceasingly according to his ordinance. By his occult power
the rivers swiftly pouring into the ocean do not fill it with water. He
makes the inverted cask to pour its waters and to moisten the ground,
while the mountains are wrapt in cloud. It is chiefly with these
a&euml;rial waters that he is connected, very rarely with the sea.</p>
<p>Varu&#7751;a&rsquo;s omniscience is often dwelt on. He knows the
flight of the birds in the sky, the path of ships in the ocean, the
course of the far-travelling wind. He beholds all the secret things
that have been or shall be done. He witnesses men&rsquo;s truth and
falsehood. No creature can even wink without him. As a moral governor
Varu&#7751;a stands far above any other deity. His wrath is roused by
sin, which is the infringement of his ordinances, and which he severely
punishes. The fetters with which he binds sinners are often mentioned.
A dispeller, hater, and punisher of falsehood, he is gracious to the
penitent. He releases men not only from the sins which they themselves
commit, but from those committed by their fathers. He spares the
suppliant who daily transgresses his laws, and is gracious to those who
have broken his ordinances by thoughtlessness. There is, in fact, no
hymn to Varu&#7751;a in which the prayer for forgiveness of guilt does
not occur, as in the hymns to other deities the prayer for worldly
goods. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span></p>
<p>With the growth of the conception of the creator, Praj&#257;pati, as
a supreme deity, the characteristics of Varu&#7751;a as a sovereign god
naturally faded away, and the dominion of waters, only a part of his
original sphere, alone remained. This is already partly the case in the
<i>Atharva-veda</i>, and in post-Vedic mythology he is only an Indian
Neptune, god of the sea.</p>
<p>The following stanzas from a hymn to Varu&#7751;a (vii. 89) will
illustrate the spirit of the prayers addressed to him:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">May I not yet, King Varu&#7751;a,</p>
<p class="line">Go down into the house of clay:</p>
<p class="line">Have mercy, spare me, mighty Lord.</p>

<p class="line">Chastise us not, O God, for that iniquity.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">There are in the <i>Rigveda</i> five solar deities,
differentiated as representing various aspects of the activity of the
sun. One of the oldest of these, Mitra, the &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; seems
to have been conceived as the beneficent side of the sun&rsquo;s power.
Going back to the Indo-Iranian period, he has in the <i>Rigveda</i>
almost entirely lost his individuality, which is practically merged in
that of Varu&#7751;a. With the latter he is constantly invoked, while
only one single hymn (iii. 59) is addressed to him alone.</p>
<p>S&#363;rya (cognate in name to the Greek H&#275;lios) is the most
concrete of the solar deities. For as his name also designates the
luminary itself, his connection with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>latter is never lost
sight of. The eye of S&#363;rya is often mentioned, and Dawn is said to
bring the eye of the gods. All-seeing, he is the spy of the whole
world, beholding all beings and the good or bad deeds of mortals.
Aroused by S&#363;rya, men pursue their objects and perform their work.
He is the soul or guardian of all that moves and is fixed. He rides in
a car, which is generally described as drawn by seven steeds. These he
unyokes at sunset:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">When he has loosed his coursers from their station,</p>
<p class="line">Straightway Night over all spreads out her garment
<span class="rm">(i. 115, 4).</span></p>
</div>
<p class="first">S&#363;rya rolls up the darkness like a skin, and the
stars slink away like thieves. He shines forth from the lap of the
dawns. He is also spoken of as the husband of Dawn. As a form of Agni,
the gods placed him in heaven. He is often described as a bird or eagle
traversing space. He measures the days and prolongs life. He drives
away disease and evil dreams. At his rising he is prayed to declare men
sinless to Mitra and Varu&#7751;a. All beings depend on S&#363;rya, and
so he is called &ldquo;all-creating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleven hymns, or about the same number as to S&#363;rya, are
addressed to another solar deity, Savit&#7771;i, the
&ldquo;Stimulator,&rdquo; who represents the quickening activity of the
sun. He is pre-eminently a golden deity, with golden hands and arms and
a golden car. He raises aloft his strong golden arms, with which he
blesses and arouses all beings, and which extend to the ends of the
earth. He moves in his golden car, seeing all creatures, on a downward
and an upward path. He shines after the path of the dawn. Beaming with
the rays of the sun, yellow-haired, Savit&#7771;i raises up his light
continually from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>the east. He removes evil dreams and drives away
demons and sorcerers. He bestows immortality on the gods as well as
length of life on man. He also conducts the departed spirit to where
the righteous dwell. The other gods follow Savit&#7771;i&rsquo;s lead;
no being, not even the most powerful gods, Indra and Varu&#7751;a, can
resist his will and independent sway. Savit&#7771;i is not infrequently
connected with the evening, being in one hymn (ii. 38) extolled as the
setting sun:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">Borne by swift coursers, he will now unyoke them:</p>
<p class="line">The speeding chariot he has stayed from going.</p>
<p class="line">He checks the speed of them that glide like
serpents:</p>
<p class="line">Night has come on by Savit&#7771;i&rsquo;s
commandment.</p>
<p class="line">The weaver rolls her outstretched web together,</p>
<p class="line">The skilled lay down their work in midst of
toiling,</p>
<p class="line">The birds all seek their nests, their shed the
cattle:</p>
<p class="line">Each to his lodging Savit&#7771;i disperses.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">To this god is addressed the most famous stanza of the
<i>Rigveda</i>, with which, as the Stimulator, he was in ancient times
invoked at the beginning of Vedic study, and which is still repeated by
every orthodox Hindu in his morning prayers. From the name of the deity
it is called the <i>S&#257;vitr&#299;</i>, but it is also often
referred to as &ldquo;the <i>G&#257;yatr&#299;</i>,&rdquo; from the
metre in which it is composed:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">May we attain that excellent</p>
<p class="line">Glory of Savit&#7771;i the god,</p>
<p class="line">That he may stimulate our thoughts <span class=
"rm">(iii. 62, 10).</span></p>
</div>
<p class="first">A peculiarity of the hymns to Savit&#7771;i is the
perpetual play on his name with forms of the root <i>s&#363;</i>,
&ldquo;to stimulate,&rdquo; from which it is derived.</p>
<p>P&#363;shan is invoked in some eight hymns of the <i>Rigveda</i>.
His name means &ldquo;Prosperer,&rdquo; and the conception <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>underlying his character seems to be the
beneficent power of the sun, manifested chiefly as a pastoral deity.
His car is drawn by goats and he carries a goad. Knowing the ways of
heaven, he conducts the dead on the far path to the fathers. He is also
a guardian of roads, protecting cattle and guiding them with his goad.
The welfare which he bestows results from the protection he extends to
men and cattle on earth, and from his guidance of mortals to the abodes
of bliss in the next world.</p>
<p>Judged by a statistical standard, Vish&#7751;u is only a deity of
the fourth rank, less frequently invoked than S&#363;rya,
Savit&#7771;i, and P&#363;shan in the <i>Rigveda</i>, but historically
he is the most important of the solar deities. For he is one of the two
great gods of modern Hinduism. The essential feature of his character
is that he takes three strides, which doubtless represent the course of
the sun through the three divisions of the universe. His highest step
is heaven, where the gods and the fathers dwell. For this abode the
poet expresses his longing in the following words (i. 154,
5):&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">May I attain to that, his well-loved dwelling,</p>
<p class="line">Where men devoted to the gods are bless&egrave;d:</p>
<p class="line">In Vish&#7751;u&rsquo;s highest step&mdash;he is our
kinsman,</p>
<p class="line">Of mighty stride&mdash;there is a spring of nectar.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Vish&#7751;u seems to have been originally conceived
as the sun, not in his general character, but as the personified
swiftly moving luminary which with vast strides traverses the three
worlds. He is in several passages said to have taken his three steps
for the benefit of man.</p>
<p>To this feature may be traced the myth of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>Br&#257;hma&#7751;as in which Vish&#7751;u appears
in the form of a dwarf as an artifice to recover the earth, now in the
possession of demons, by taking his three strides. His character for
benevolence was in post-Vedic mythology developed in the doctrine of
the Avat&#257;rs (&ldquo;descents&rdquo; to earth) or incarnations
which he assumed for the good of humanity.</p>
<p>Ushas, goddess of dawn, is almost the only female deity to whom
entire hymns are addressed, and the only one invoked with any
frequency. She, however, is celebrated in some twenty hymns. The name,
meaning the &ldquo;Shining One,&rdquo; is cognate to the Latin
<i>Aurora</i> and the Greek <i>&#274;&#333;s</i>. When the goddess is
addressed, the physical phenomenon of dawn is never absent from the
poet&rsquo;s mind. The fondness with which the thoughts of these
priestly singers turned to her alone among the goddesses, though she
received no share in the offering of soma like the other gods, seems to
show that the glories of the dawn, more splendid in Northern India than
those we are wont to see, deeply impressed the minds of these early
poets. In any case, she is their most graceful creation, the charm of
which is unsurpassed in the descriptive religious lyrics of any other
literature. Here there are no priestly subtleties to obscure the
brightness of her form, and few allusions to the sacrifice to mar the
natural beauty of the imagery.</p>
<p>To enable the reader to estimate the merit of this poetry I will
string together some utterances about the Dawn goddess, culled from
various hymns, and expressed as nearly as possible in the words of
their composers. Ushas is a radiant maiden, born in the sky, daughter
of Dyaus. She is the bright sister of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb82" href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>dark Night. She shines
with the light of her lover, with the light of S&#363;rya, who beams
after her path and follows her as a young man a maiden. She is borne on
a brilliant car, drawn by ruddy steeds or kine. Arraying herself in gay
attire like a dancer, she displays her bosom. Clothed upon with light,
the maiden appears in the east and unveils her charms. Rising
resplendent as from a bath, she shows her form. Effulgent in peerless
beauty, she withholds her light from neither small nor great. She opens
wide the gates of heaven; she opens the doors of darkness, as the cows
(issue from) their stall. Her radiant beams appear like herds of
cattle. She removes the black robe of night, warding off evil spirits
and the hated darkness. She awakens creatures that have feet, and makes
the birds fly up: she is the breath and life of everything. When Ushas
shines forth, the birds fly up from their nests and men seek
nourishment. She is the radiant mover of sweet sounds, the leader of
the charm of pleasant voices. Day by day appearing at the appointed
place, she never infringes the rule of order and of the gods; she goes
straight along the path of order; knowing the way, she never loses her
direction. As she shone in former days, so she shines now and will
shine in future, never aging, immortal.</p>
<p>The solitude and stillness of the early morning sometimes suggested
pensive thoughts about the fleeting nature of human life in contrast
with the unending recurrence of the dawn. Thus one poet
exclaims:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">Gone are the mortals who in former ages</p>
<p class="line">Beheld the flushing of the earlier morning.</p>
<p class="line">We living men now look upon her shining;</p>
<p class="line">They are coming who shall in future see her
<span class="rm">(i. 113, 11).</span></p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span></p>
<p>In a similar strain another Rishi sings:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">Again and again newly born though ancient,</p>
<p class="line">Decking her beauty with the self-same colours,</p>
<p class="line">The goddess wastes away the life of mortals,</p>
<p class="line">Like wealth diminished by the skilful player
<span class="rm">(i. 92, 10).</span></p>
</div>
<p class="first">The following stanzas from one of the finest hymns to
Dawn (i. 113) furnish a more general picture of this fairest creation
of Vedic poetry:&mdash;</p>

<p>Among the deities of celestial light, those most frequently invoked
are the twin gods of morning named A&ccedil;vins. They are the sons of
Heaven, eternally young and handsome. They ride on a car, on which they
are accompanied by the sun-maiden S&#363;ry&#257;. This car is bright
and sunlike, and all its parts are golden. The time when these gods
appear is the early dawn, when &ldquo;darkness still stands among the
ruddy cows.&rdquo; At the yoking of their car Ushas is born.</p>
<p>Many myths are told about the A&ccedil;vins as succouring
divinities. They deliver from distress in general, especially rescuing
from the ocean in a ship or ships. They are characteristically divine
physicians, who give sight to the blind and make the lame to walk. One
very curious myth is that of the maiden Vi&ccedil;pal&#257;, who having
had her leg cut off in some conflict, was at once furnished by the
A&ccedil;vins with an iron limb. They agree in many respects with the
two famous horsemen of Greek mythology, the Dioskouroi, sons of Zeus
and brothers of Helen. The two most probable theories as to the origin
of these twin deities are, that they represent either the twilight,
half dark, half light, or the morning and evening star.</p>
<p>In the realm of air Indra is the dominant deity. He is, indeed, the
favourite and national god of the Vedic Indian. His importance is
sufficiently indicated by the fact that more than one-fourth of the
<i>Rigveda</i> is devoted to his praise. Handed down from a bygone age,
Indra has become more anthropomorphic and surrounded by mythological
imagery than any other Vedic god. The significance of his character is
nevertheless sufficiently clear. He is primarily the thunder-god, the
conquest of the demon of drought or darkness named V&#7771;itra, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>&ldquo;Obstructor,&rdquo; and the consequent
liberation of the waters or the winning of light, forming his
mythological essence. This myth furnishes the Rishis with an
ever-recurring theme. Armed with his thunderbolt, exhilarated by
copious draughts of soma, and generally escorted by the Maruts or
Storm-gods, Indra enters upon the fray. The conflict is terrible.
Heaven and earth tremble with fear when Indra smites V&#7771;itra like
a tree with his bolt. He is described as constantly repeating the
combat. This obviously corresponds to the perpetual renewal of the
natural phenomena underlying the myth. The physical elements in the
thunderstorm are seldom directly mentioned by the poets when describing
the exploits of Indra. He is rarely said to shed rain, but constantly
to release the pent-up waters or rivers. The lightning is regularly the
&ldquo;bolt,&rdquo; while thunder is the lowing of the cows or the
roaring of the dragon. The clouds are designated by various names, such
as cow, udder, spring, cask, or pail. They are also rocks (<i lang=
"sa-latn">adri</i>), which encompass the cows set free by Indra. They
are further mountains from which Indra casts down the demons dwelling
upon them. They thus often become fortresses (<i lang=
"sa-latn">pur</i>) of the demons, which are ninety, ninety-nine, or a
hundred in number, and are variously described as &ldquo;moving,&rdquo;
&ldquo;autumnal,&rdquo; &ldquo;made of iron or stone.&rdquo; One stanza
(x. 89, 7) thus brings together the various features of the myth:
&ldquo;Indra slew V&#7771;itra, broke the castles, made a channel for
the rivers, pierced the mountain, and delivered over the cows to his
friends.&rdquo; Owing to the importance of the V&#7771;itra myth, the
chief and specific epithet of Indra is <i lang=
"sa-latn">V&#7771;itrahan</i>, &ldquo;slayer of V&#7771;itra.&rdquo;
The following stanzas are from one of the most graphic of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>hymns which celebrate the conflict of Indra with
the demon (i. 32):&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">I will proclaim the manly deeds of Indra,</p>
<p class="line">The first that he performed, the lightning-wielder.</p>
<p class="line">He smote the dragon, then discharged the waters,</p>
<p class="line">And cleft the caverns of the lofty mountains.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Impetuous as a bull, he chose the soma,</p>
<p class="line">And drank in threefold vessels of its juices.</p>
<p class="line">The Bounteous god grasped lightning for his
missile,</p>
<p class="line">He struck down dead that first-born of the dragons.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Him lightning then avail&egrave;d naught, nor
thunder,</p>
<p class="line">Nor mist nor hailstorm which he spread around him:</p>
<p class="line">When Indra and the dragon strove in battle,</p>
<p class="line">The Bounteous god gained victory for ever.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Plunged in the midst of never-ceasing torrents,</p>
<p class="line">That stand not still but ever hasten onward,</p>
<p class="line">The waters bear off V&#7771;itra&rsquo;s hidden
body:</p>
<p class="line">Indra&rsquo;s fierce foe sank down to lasting
darkness.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">With the liberation of the waters is connected the
winning of light and the sun. Thus we read that when Indra had slain
the dragon V&#7771;itra with his bolt, releasing the waters for man, he
placed the sun visibly in the heavens, or that the sun shone forth when
Indra blew the dragon from the air.</p>
<p>Indra naturally became the god of battle, and is more frequently
invoked than any other deity as a helper in conflicts with earthly
enemies. In the words of one poet, he protects the Aryan colour
(<i>var&#7751;a</i>) and subjects the black skin; while another extols
him for having dispersed 50,000 of the black race and rent their
citadels. His combats are frequently called <i>gavish&#7789;i</i>,
&ldquo;desire of cows,&rdquo; his gifts being considered the result of
victories.</p>
<p>The following stanzas (ii. 12, 2 and 13) will serve as a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span>specimen of the way in which the greatness of
Indra is celebrated:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Who made the widespread earth when quaking
steadfast,</p>
<p class="line">Who brought to rest the agitated mountains.</p>
<p class="line">Who measured out air&rsquo;s intermediate spaces,</p>
<p class="line">Who gave the sky support: he, men, is Indra.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Heaven and earth themselves bow down before him,</p>
<p class="line">Before his might the very mountains tremble.</p>
<p class="line">Who, known as Soma-drinker, armed with lightning,</p>
<p class="line">Is wielder of the bolt: he, men, is Indra.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">To the more advanced anthropomorphism of Indra&rsquo;s
nature are due the occasional immoral traits which appear in his
character. Thus he sometimes indulges in acts of capricious violence,
such as the slaughter of his father or the destruction of the car of
Dawn. He is especially addicted to soma, of which he is described as
drinking enormous quantities to stimulate him in the performance of his
warlike exploits. One entire hymn (x. 119) consists of a monologue in
which Indra, inebriated with soma, boasts of his greatness and power.
Though of little poetic merit, this piece has a special interest as
being by far the earliest literary description of the mental effects,
braggadocio in particular, produced by intoxication. In estimating the
morality of Indra&rsquo;s excesses, it should not be forgotten that the
exhilaration of soma partook of a religious character in the eyes of
the Vedic poets.</p>
<p>Indra&rsquo;s name is found in the <i>Avesta</i> as that of a demon.
His distinctive Vedic epithet, <i>V&#7771;itrahan</i>, also occurs
there in the form of <i>verethraghna</i>, as a designation of the god
of victory. Hence there was probably in the Indo-Iranian period a god
approaching to the Vedic form of the V&#7771;itra-slaying and
victorious Indra. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88"
name="pb88">88</a>]</span></p>
<p>In comparing historically Varu&#7751;a and Indra, whose importance
was about equal in the earlier period of the <i>Rigveda</i>, it seems
clear that Varu&#7751;a was greater in the Indo-Iranian period, but
became inferior to Indra in later Vedic times. Indra, on the other
hand, became in the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as and Epics the chief of the
Indian heaven, and even maintained this position under the Puranic
triad, Brahm&#257;-Vish&#7751;u-&Ccedil;iva, though of course
subordinate to them.</p>
<p>At least three of the lesser deities of the air are connected with
lightning. One of these is the somewhat obscure god Trita, who is only
mentioned in detached verses of the <i>Rigveda</i>. The name appears to
designate the &ldquo;third&rdquo; (Greek, <i>trito-s</i>), as the
lightning form of fire. His frequent epithet, <i>&#256;ptya</i>, seems
to mean the &ldquo;watery.&rdquo; This god goes back to the
Indo-Iranian period, as both his name and his epithet are found in the
<i>Avesta</i>. But he was gradually ousted by Indra as being originally
almost identical in character with the latter. Another deity of rare
occurrence in the <i>Rigveda</i>, and also dating from the Indo-Iranian
period, is Ap&#257;m&#803; nap&#257;t, the &ldquo;Son of Waters.&rdquo;
He is described as clothed in lightning and shining without fuel in the
waters. There can, therefore, be little doubt that he represents fire
as produced from the rain-clouds in the form of lightning.
M&#257;tari&ccedil;van, seldom mentioned in the <i>Rigveda</i>, is a
divine being described as having, like the Greek Prometheus, brought
down the hidden fire from heaven to earth. He most probably represents
the personification of a celestial form of Agni, god of fire, with whom
he is in some passages actually identified. In the later Vedas, the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;as, and the subsequent literature, the name has
become simply a designation of wind. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span></p>
<p>The position occupied by the god Rudra in the <i>Rigveda</i> is very
different from that of his historical successor in a later age. He is
celebrated in only three or four hymns, while his name is mentioned
slightly less often than that of Vish&#7751;u. He is usually said to be
armed with bow and arrows, but a lightning shaft and a thunderbolt are
also occasionally assigned to him. He is described as fierce and
destructive like a wild beast, and is called &ldquo;the ruddy boar of
heaven.&rdquo; The hymns addressed to him chiefly express fear of his
terrible shafts and deprecation of his wrath. His malevolence is still
more prominent in the later Vedic literature. The euphemistic epithet
<i>&Ccedil;iva</i>, &ldquo;auspicious,&rdquo; already applied to him in
the <i>Rigveda</i>, and more frequently, though not exclusively, in the
younger Vedas, became his regular name in the post-Vedic period. Rudra
is, of course, not purely malevolent like a demon. He is besought not
only to preserve from calamity but to bestow blessings and produce
welfare for man and beast. His healing powers are mentioned with
especial frequency, and he is lauded as the greatest of physicians.</p>
<p>Prominent among the gods of the <i>Rigveda</i> are the Maruts or
Storm-gods, who form a group of thrice seven or thrice sixty. They are
the sons of Rudra and the mottled cloud-cow P&#7771;i&ccedil;ni. At
birth they are compared with fires, and are once addressed as
&ldquo;born from the laughter of lightning.&rdquo; They are a troop of
youthful warriors armed with spears or battle-axes and wearing helmets
upon their heads. They are decked with golden ornaments, chiefly in the
form of armlets or of anklets:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">They gleam with armlets as the heavens are decked with
stars;</p>
<p class="line">Like cloud-born lightnings shine the torrents of their

<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=

<p>The God of Wind, called V&#257;yu or V&#257;ta, is not a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span>prominent deity in the <i>Rigveda</i>, having only
three entire hymns addressed to him. The personification is more
developed under the name of V&#257;yu, who is mostly associated with
Indra, while V&#257;ta is coupled only with the less anthropomorphic
rain-god, Parjanya. V&#257;yu is swift as thought and has roaring
velocity. He has a shining car drawn by a team or a pair of ruddy
steeds. On this car, which has a golden seat and touches the sky, Indra
is his companion. V&#257;ta, as also the ordinary designation of wind,
is celebrated in a more concrete manner. His name is often connected
with the verb <i>v&#257;</i>, &ldquo;to blow,&rdquo; from which it is
derived. Like Rudra, he wafts healing and prolongs life; for he has the
treasure of immortality in his house. The poet of a short <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e2472" title="Source: hynm">hymn</span> (x. 168) devoted
to his praise thus describes him:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">

<p class="line">This V&#257;ta let us now with offerings worship.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">Another deity of air is Parjanya, god of rain, who is
invoked in but three hymns, and is only mentioned some thirty times in
the <i>Rigveda</i>. The name in several passages still means simply
&ldquo;rain-cloud.&rdquo; The personification is therefore always
closely connected with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92"
name="pb92">92</a>]</span>the phenomenon of the rain-storm, in which
the rain-cloud itself becomes an udder, a pail, or a water-skin. Often
likened to a bull, Parjanya is characteristically a shedder of rain.
His activity is described in very vivid strains (v. 83):&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">The trees he strikes to earth and smites the demon

</div>
</div>
<p class="first">The Waters are praised as goddesses in four hymns of
the <i>Rigveda</i>. The personification, however, hardly goes beyond
representing them as mothers, young wives, and goddesses who bestow
boons and come to the sacrifice. As mothers they produce Agni, whose
lightning form is, as we have seen, called Ap&#257;m&#803; Nap&#257;t,
&ldquo;Son of Waters.&rdquo; The divine waters bear away defilement,
and are even invoked to cleanse from moral guilt, the sins of violence,
cursing, and lying. They bestow remedies, healing, long life, and
immortality. Soma delights in the waters as a young man in lovely
maidens; he approaches them as a lover; they are maidens who bow down
before the youth.</p>
<p>Several rivers are personified and invoked as deities <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>in the
<i>Rigveda</i>. One hymn (x. 75) celebrates the Sindhu or Indus, while
another (iii. 33) sings the praises of the sister streams
Vip&#257;&ccedil; and &Ccedil;utudr&#299;. Sarasvat&#299; is, however,
the most important river goddess, being lauded in three entire hymns as
well as in many detached verses. The personification here goes much
further than in the case of other streams; but the poets never lose
sight of the connection of the goddess with the river. She is the best
of mothers, of rivers, and of goddesses. Her unfailing breast yields
riches of every kind, and she bestows wealth, plenty, nourishment, and
offspring. One poet prays that he may not be removed from her to fields
which are strange. She is invoked to descend from the sky, from the
great mountain, to the sacrifice. Such expressions may have suggested
the notion of the celestial origin and descent of the Ganges, familiar
to post-Vedic mythology. Though simply a river deity in the
<i>Rigveda</i>, Sarasvat&#299; is in the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as
identified with V&#257;ch, goddess of speech, and has in post-Vedic
mythology become the goddess of eloquence and wisdom, invoked as a
muse, and regarded as the wife of Brahm&#257;.</p>
<p>Earth, P&#7771;ithiv&#299;, the Broad One, hardly ever dissociated
from Dyaus, is celebrated alone in only one short hymn of three stanzas
(v. 84). Even here the poet cannot refrain from introducing references
to her heavenly spouse as he addresses the goddess,</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">Who, firmly fixt, the forest trees</p>
<p class="line">With might supportest in the ground:</p>
<p class="line">When from the lightning of thy cloud</p>
<p class="line">The rain-floods of the sky pour down.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The personification is only rudimentary, the
attributes of the goddess being chiefly those of the physical
earth.</p>
<p>The most important of the terrestrial deities is Agni, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span>god of
fire. Next to Indra he is the most prominent of the Vedic gods, being
celebrated in more than 200 hymns. It is only natural that the
personification of the sacrificial fire, the centre around which the
ritual poetry of the Veda moves, should engross so much of the
attention of the Rishis. <i>Agni</i> being also the regular name of the
element (Latin, <i>igni-s</i>), the anthropomorphism of the deity is
but slight. The bodily parts of the god have a clear connection with
the phenomena of terrestrial fire mainly in its sacrificial aspect. In
allusion to the oblation of ghee cast in the fire, Agni is
&ldquo;butter-backed,&rdquo; &ldquo;butter-faced,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;butter-haired.&rdquo; He is also &ldquo;flame-haired,&rdquo; and
has a tawny beard. He has sharp, shining, golden, or iron teeth and
burning jaws. Mention is also often made of his tongue or tongues. He
is frequently compared with or directly called a steed, being yoked to
the pole of the rite in order to waft the sacrifice to the gods. He is
also often likened to a bird, being winged and darting with rapid
flight to the gods. He eats and chews the forest with sharp tooth. His
lustre is like the rays of dawn or of the sun, and resembles the
lightnings of the rain-cloud; but his track and his fellies are black,
and his steeds make black furrows. Driven by the wind, he rushes
through the wood. He invades the forests and shears the hairs of the
earth, shaving it as a barber a beard. His flames are like the roaring
waves of the sea. He bellows like a bull when he invades the forest
trees; the birds are terrified at the noise when his grass-devouring
sparks arise. Like the erector of a pillar, he supports the sky with
his smoke; and one of his distinctive epithets is
&ldquo;smoke-bannered.&rdquo; He is borne on a brilliant car, drawn by
two or more steeds, which are ruddy or tawny and wind-impelled.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>He yokes them to summon the gods, for he is the
charioteer of the sacrifice.</p>
<p>The poets love to dwell on his various births, forms, and abodes.
They often refer to the daily generation of Agni by friction from the
two fire-sticks. These are his parents, producing him as a new-born
infant who is hard to catch. From the dry wood the god is born living;
the child as soon as born devours his parents. The ten maidens said to
produce him are the ten fingers used in twirling the upright
fire-drill. Agni is called &ldquo;Son of strength&rdquo; because of the
powerful friction necessary in kindling a flame. As the fire is lit
every morning for the sacrifice, Agni is described as &ldquo;waking at
dawn.&rdquo; Hence, too, he is the &ldquo;youngest&rdquo; of the gods;
but he is also old, for he conducted the first sacrifice. Thus he comes
to be paradoxically called both &ldquo;ancient&rdquo; and &ldquo;very
young&rdquo; in the same passage.</p>
<p>Agni also springs from the a&euml;rial waters, and is often said to
have been brought from heaven. Born on earth, in air, in heaven, Agni
is frequently regarded as having a triple character. The gods made him
threefold, his births are three, and he has three abodes or dwellings.
&ldquo;From heaven first Agni was born, the second time from us
(<i>i.e.</i> men), thirdly in the waters.&rdquo; This earliest Indian
trinity is important as the basis of much of the mystical speculation
of the Vedic age. It was probably the prototype not only of the later
Rigvedic triad, Sun, Wind, Fire, spoken of as distributed in the three
worlds, but also of the triad Sun, Indra, Fire, which, though not
Rigvedic, is still ancient. It is most likely also the historical
progenitor of the later Hindu trinity of Brahm&#257;, Vish&#7751;u,
&Ccedil;iva. This triad of fires may have suggested and would explain
the division of a single <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href=
"#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>sacrificial fire into the three which
form an essential feature of the cult of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</p>
<p>Owing to the multiplicity of terrestrial fires, Agni is also said to
have many births; for he abides in every family, house, or dwelling.
Kindled in many spots, he is but one; scattered in many places, he is
one and the same king. Other fires are attached to him as branches to a
tree. He assumes various divine forms, and has many names; but in him
are comprehended all the gods, whom he surrounds as a felly the spokes.
Thus we find the speculations about Agni&rsquo;s various forms leading
to the monotheistic notion of a unity pervading the many manifestations
of the divine.</p>
<p>Agni is an immortal who has taken up his abode among mortals; he is
constantly called a &ldquo;guest&rdquo; in human dwellings; and is the
only god to whom the frequent epithet <i>g&#7771;ihapati</i>,
&ldquo;lord of the house,&rdquo; is applied.</p>
<p>As the conductor of sacrifice, Agni is repeatedly called both a
&ldquo;messenger&rdquo; who moves between heaven and earth and a
priest. He is indeed the great priest, just as Indra is the great
warrior.</p>
<p>Agni is, moreover, a mighty benefactor of his worshippers. With a
thousand eyes he watches over the man who offers him oblations; but
consumes his worshippers&rsquo; enemies like dry bushes, and strikes
down the malevolent like a tree destroyed by lightning. All blessings
issue from him as branches from a tree. All treasures are collected in
him, and he opens the door of wealth. He gives rain from heaven and is
like a spring in the desert. The boons which he confers are, however,
chiefly domestic welfare, offspring, and general prosperity, while
Indra for the most part grants victory, booty, power, and glory.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=
"pb97">97</a>]</span></p>
<p>Probably the oldest function of fire in regard to its cult is that
of burning and dispelling evil spirits and hostile magic. It still
survives in the <i>Rigveda</i> from an earlier age, Agni being said to
drive away the goblins with his light and receiving the epithet
<i>rakshohan</i>, &ldquo;goblin-slayer.&rdquo; This activity is at any
rate more characteristic of Agni than of any other deity, both in the
hymns and in the ritual of the Vedas.</p>
<p>Since the soma sacrifice, beside the cult of fire, forms a main
feature in the ritual of the <i>Rigveda</i>, the god Soma is naturally
one of its chief deities. The whole of the ninth book, in addition to a
few scattered hymns elsewhere, is devoted to his praise. Thus, judged
by the standard of frequency of mention, Soma comes third in order of
importance among the Vedic gods. The constant presence of the soma
plant and its juice before their eyes set limits to the imagination of
the poets who describe its personification. Hence little is said of
Soma&rsquo;s human form or action. The ninth book mainly consists of
incantations sung over the soma while it is pressed by the stones and
flows through the woollen strainer into the wooden vats, in which it is
finally offered as a beverage to the gods on a litter of grass. The
poets are chiefly concerned with these processes, overlaying them with
chaotic imagery and mystical fancies of almost infinite variety. When
Soma is described as being purified by the ten maidens who are sisters,
or by the daughters of Vivasvat (the rising sun), the ten fingers are
meant. The stones used in pounding the shoots on a skin &ldquo;chew him
on the hide of a cow.&rdquo; The flowing of the juice into jars or vats
after passing through the filter of sheep&rsquo;s wool is described in
various ways. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98"
name="pb98">98</a>]</span>streams of soma rush to the forest of the
vats like buffaloes. The god flies like a bird to settle in the vats.
The Tawny One settles in the bowls like a bird sitting on a tree. The
juice being mixed with water in the vat, Soma is said to rush into the
lap of the waters like a roaring bull on the herd. Clothing himself in
waters, he rushes around the vat, impelled by the singers. Playing in
the wood, he is cleansed by the ten maidens. He is the embryo or child
of waters, which are called his mothers. When the priests add milk to
soma &ldquo;they clothe him in cow-garments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound made by the soma juice flowing into the vats or bowls is
often referred to in hyperbolical language. Thus a poet says that
&ldquo;the sweet drop flows over the filter like the din of
combatants.&rdquo; This sound is constantly described as roaring,
bellowing, or occasionally even thundering. In such passages Soma is
commonly compared with or called a bull, and the waters, with or
without milk, are termed cows.</p>
<p>Owing to the yellow colour of the juice, the physical quality of
Soma mainly dwelt upon by the poets is his brilliance. His rays are
often referred to, and he is frequently assimilated to the sun.</p>
<p>The exhilarating and invigorating action of soma led to its being
regarded as a divine drink that bestows everlasting life. Hence it is
called <i>am&#7771;ita</i>, the &ldquo;immortal&rdquo; draught (allied
to the Greek <i>ambrosia</i>). Soma is the stimulant which conferred
immortality upon the gods. Soma also places his worshipper in the
imperishable world where there is eternal light and glory, making him
immortal where King Yama dwells. Thus soma naturally has medicinal
power also. It is medicine for a sick man, and the god Soma heals
whatever <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>is sick, making the blind to see and the lame to
walk.</p>
<p>Soma when imbibed stimulates the voice, which it impels as the rower
his boat. Soma also awakens eager thought, and the worshippers of the
god exclaim, &ldquo;We have drunk soma, we have become immortal, we
have entered into light, we have known the gods.&rdquo; The
intoxicating power of soma is chiefly, and very frequently, dwelt on in
connection with Indra, whom it stimulates in his conflict with the
hostile demons of the air.</p>
<p>Being the most important of herbs, soma is spoken of as lord of
plants or their king, receiving also the epithet <i>vanaspati</i>,
&ldquo;lord of the forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soma is several times described as dwelling or growing on the
mountains, in accordance with the statements of the <i>Avesta</i> about
Haoma. Its true origin and abode is regarded as heaven, whence it has
been brought down to earth. This belief is most frequently embodied in
the myth of the soma-bringing eagle (<i>&ccedil;yena</i>), which is
probably only the mythological account of the simple phenomenon of the
descent of lightning and the simultaneous fall of rain.</p>
<p>In some of the latest hymns of the <i>Rigveda</i> Soma begins to be
somewhat obscurely identified with the moon. In the <i>Atharva-veda</i>
Soma several times means the moon, and in the <i>Yajurveda</i> Soma is
spoken of as having the lunar mansions for his wives. The
identification is a commonplace in the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as, which
explain the waning of the moon as due to the gods and fathers eating up
the ambrosia of which it consists. In one of the Upanishads, moreover,
the statement occurs that the moon is King Soma, the food of the gods,
and is drunk up by them. Finally, in post-Vedic literature Soma is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>a regular name of the moon, which is regarded as
being consumed by the gods, and consequently waning till it is filled
up again by the sun. This somewhat remarkable coalescence of Soma with
the moon doubtless sprang from the hyperbolical terms in which the
poets of the <i>Rigveda</i> dwell on Soma&rsquo;s celestial nature and
brilliance, which they describe as dispelling darkness. They sometimes
speak of it as swelling in the waters, and often refer to the sap as a
&ldquo;drop&rdquo; (<i>indu</i>). Comparisons with the moon would thus
easily suggest themselves. In one passage of the <i>Rigveda</i>, for
instance, Soma in the bowls is said to appear like the moon in the
waters. The mystical speculations with which the Soma poetry teems
would soon complete the symbolism.</p>
<p>A comparison of the <i>Avesta</i> with the <i>Rigveda</i> shows
clearly that soma was already an important feature in the mythology and
cult of the Indo-Iranian age. In both it is described as growing on the
mountains, whence it is brought by birds; in both it is king of plants;
in both a medicine bestowing long life and removing death. In both the
sap was pressed and mixed with milk; in both its mythical home is
heaven, whence it comes down to earth; in both the draught has become a
mighty god; in both the celestial Soma is distinguished from the
terrestrial, the god from the beverage. The similarity goes so far that
Soma and Haoma have even some individual epithets in common.</p>
<p>The evolution of thought in the Rigvedic period shows a tendency to
advance from the concrete to the abstract. One result of this tendency
is the creation of abstract deities, which, however, are still rare,
occurring for the most part in the last book only. A few of them are
deifications of abstract nouns, such as &Ccedil;raddh&#257;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>&ldquo;Faith,&rdquo; invoked in one short hymn,
and Manyu, &ldquo;Wrath,&rdquo; in two. These abstractions grow more
numerous in the later Vedas. Thus K&#257;ma, &ldquo;Desire,&rdquo;
first appears in the <i>Atharva-veda</i>, where the arrows with which
he pierces hearts are already referred to; he is the forerunner of the
flower-arrowed god of love, familiar in classical literature. More
numerous is the class of abstractions comprising deities whose names
denote an agent, such as <i>Dh&#257;t&#7771;i</i>,
&ldquo;Creator,&rdquo; or an attribute, such as <i>Praj&#257;pati</i>,
&ldquo;Lord of Creatures.&rdquo; These do not appear to be direct
abstractions, but seem to be derived from epithets designating a
particular aspect of activity or character, which at first applying to
one or more of the older deities, finally acquired an independent
value. Thus <i>Praj&#257;pati</i>, originally an epithet of such gods
as Savit&#7771;i and Soma, occurs in a late verse of the last book as a
distinct deity possessing the attribute of a creator. This god is in
the <i>Atharva-veda</i> and the
<i>V&#257;jasaneyi-Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i> often, and in the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;as regularly, recognised as the chief deity, the
father of the gods. In the S&#363;tras, Praj&#257;pati is identified
with Brahm&#257;, his successor in the post-Vedic age.</p>
<p>A hymn of the tenth book furnishes an interesting illustration of
the curious way in which such abstractions sometimes come into being.
Here is one of the stanzas:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">By whom the mighty sky, the earth so steadfast,</p>
<p class="line">The realm of light, heaven&rsquo;s vault, has been
established,</p>
<p class="line">Who in the air the boundless space traverses:</p>
<p class="line">What god should we with sacrifices worship?</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The fourth line here is the refrain of nine successive
stanzas, in which the creator is referred to as unknown, with the
interrogative pronoun <i>ka</i>, &ldquo;what?&rdquo; This <i>ka</i> in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>the later Vedic literature came to be employed
not only as an epithet of the creator Praj&#257;pati, but even as an
independent name of the supreme god.</p>
<p>A deity of an abstract character occurring in the oldest as well as
the latest parts of the <i>Rigveda</i> is B&#7771;ihaspati, &ldquo;Lord
of Prayer.&rdquo; Roth and other distinguished Vedic scholars regard
him as a direct personification of devotion. In the opinion of the
present writer, however, he is only an indirect deification of the
sacrificial activity of Agni, a god with whom he has undoubtedly much
in common. Thus the most prominent feature of his character is his
priesthood. Like Agni, he has been drawn into and has obtained a firm
footing in the Indra myth. Thus he is often described as driving out
the cows after vanquishing the demon Vala. As the divine
<i>brahm&#257;</i> priest, B&#7771;ihaspati seems to have been the
prototype of the god Brahm&#257;, chief of the later Hindu trinity. But
the name B&#7771;ihaspati itself survived in post-Vedic mythology as
the designation of a sage, the teacher of the gods, and regent of the
planet Jupiter.</p>
<p>Another abstraction, and one of a very peculiar kind, is the goddess
Aditi. Though not the subject of any separate hymn, she is often
incidentally celebrated. She has two, and only two, prominent
characteristics. She is, in the first place, the mother of the small
group of gods called &#256;dityas, of whom Varu&#7751;a is the chief.
Secondly, she has, like her son Varu&#7751;a, the power of releasing
from the bonds of physical suffering and moral guilt. With the latter
trait her name, which means &ldquo;unbinding,&rdquo;
&ldquo;freedom,&rdquo; is clearly connected. The unpersonified sense
seems to survive in a few passages of the <i>Rigveda</i>. Thus a poet
prays for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>&ldquo;secure and unlimited gift of
<i>aditi</i>.&rdquo; The origin of the abstraction is probably to be
explained as follows. The expression &ldquo;sons of Aditi,&rdquo; which
is several times applied to the &#256;dityas, when first used in all
likelihood meant &ldquo;sons of liberation,&rdquo; to emphasise a
salient trait of their character, according to a turn of language
common in the <i>Rigveda</i>. The feminine word
&ldquo;liberation&rdquo; (<i>aditi</i>) used in this connection would
then have become personified by a process which has more than one
parallel in Sanskrit. Thus Aditi, a goddess of Indian origin, is
historically younger than some at least of her sons, who can be traced
back to a pre-Indian age.</p>
<p>Goddesses, as a whole, occupy a very subordinate position in Vedic
belief. They play hardly any part as rulers of the world. The only one
of any consequence is Ushas. The next in importance, Sarasvat&#299;,
ranks only with the least prominent of the male gods. One of the few,
besides P&#7771;ithiv&#299;, to whom an entire hymn is addressed, is
R&#257;tr&#299;, Night. Like her sister Dawn, with whom she is often
coupled, she is addressed as a daughter of the sky. She is conceived
not as the dark, but as the bright starlit night. Thus, in contrasting
the twin goddesses, a poet says, &ldquo;One decks herself with stars,
with sunlight the other.&rdquo; The following stanzas are from the hymn
addressed to Night (x. 127):&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">

<p class="first">Goddesses, as wives of the great gods, play a still
more insignificant part, being entirely devoid of independent
character. Indeed, hardly anything about them is mentioned but their
names, which are simply formed from those of their male consorts by
means of feminine suffixes.</p>
<p>A peculiar feature of Vedic mythology is the invocation in couples
of a number of deities whose names are combined in the form of dual
compounds. About a dozen such pairs are celebrated in entire hymns, and
some half-dozen others in detached stanzas. By far the greatest number
of such hymns is addressed to Mitra-Varu&#7751;a, but the names most
often found combined in this way are those of Heaven and Earth
(<i>Dy&#257;v&#257;p&#7771;ithiv&#299;</i>). There can be little doubt
that the latter couple furnished the analogy for this favourite
formation. For the association of this pair, traceable as far back as
the Indo-European period, appeared to early thought so intimate in
nature, that the myth of their conjugal union is found widely diffused
among primitive peoples. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href=
"#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span></p>
<p>Besides these pairs of deities there is a certain number of more or
less definite groups of divine beings generally associated with some
particular god. The largest and most important of these are the Maruts
or Storm-gods, who, as we have seen, constantly attend Indra on his
warlike exploits. The same group, under the name of Rudras, is
occasionally associated with their father Rudra. The smaller group of
the &#256;dityas is constantly mentioned in company with their mother
Aditi, or their chief Varu&#7751;a. Their number in two passages of the
<i>Rigveda</i> is stated as seven or eight, while in the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;as and later it is regularly twelve. Some eight or
ten hymns of the <i>Rigveda</i> are addressed to them collectively. The
following lines are taken from one (viii. 47) in which their aid and
protection is specially invoked:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">As birds extend their sheltering wings,</p>
<p class="line">Spread your protection over us.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">As charioteers avoid ill roads,</p>
<p class="line">May dangers always pass us by.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Resting in you, O gods, we are</p>
<p class="line">Like men that fight in coats of mail.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Look down on us, O &#256;dityas,</p>
<p class="line">Like spies observing from the bank:</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Lead us to paths of pleasantness,</p>
<p class="line">Like horses to an easy ford.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">A third and much less important group is that of the
Vasus, mostly associated with Indra in the <i>Rigveda</i>, though in
later Vedic texts Agni becomes their leader. They are a vague group,
for they are not characterised, having neither individual names nor any
definite number. The Br&#257;hma&#7751;as, however, mention eight of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>them. Finally, there are the
Vi&ccedil;vedev&#257;s or All-gods, to whom some sixty hymns are
addressed. It is a factitious sacrificial group meant to embrace the
whole pantheon in order that none should be excluded in invocations
intended to be addressed to all. Strange to say, the All-gods are
sometimes conceived as a narrower group, which is invoked with others
like the Vasus and &#256;dityas.</p>
<p>Besides the higher gods the <i>Rigveda</i> knows a number of
mythical beings not regarded as possessing the divine nature to the
full extent and from the beginning. The most important of these are the
&#7770;ibhus who form a triad, and are addressed in eleven hymns.
Characteristically deft-handed, they are often said to have acquired
the rank of deities by their marvellous skill. Among the five great
feats of dexterity whereby they became gods, the greatest&mdash;in
which they appear as successful rivals of Tvash&#7789;&#7771;i, the
artificer god&mdash;consists in their having transformed his bowl, the
drinking vessel of the gods, into four shining cups. This bowl perhaps
represents the moon, the four cups being its phases. It has also been
interpreted as the year with its division into seasons. The
&#7770;ibhus are further said to have renewed the youth of their
parents, by whom Heaven and Earth seem to have been meant. With this
miraculous deed another myth told about them appears to be specially
connected. They rested for twelve days in the house of the sun, Agohya
(&ldquo;who cannot be concealed&rdquo;). This sojourn of the
&#7770;ibhus in the house of the sun in all probability alludes to the
winter solstice, the twelve days being the addition which was necessary
to bring the lunar year of 354 into harmony with the solar year of
nearly 366 days, and was intercalated before the days begin to grow
perceptibly longer. On the whole, it seems likely that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>the
&#7770;ibhus were originally terrestrial or a&euml;rial elves, whose
dexterity gradually attracted to them various myths illustrative of
marvellous skill.</p>
<p>In a few passages of the <i>Rigveda</i> mention is made of a
celestial water-nymph called Apsaras (&ldquo;moving in the
waters&rdquo;), who is regarded as the spouse of a corresponding male
genius called Gandharva. The Apsaras, in the words of the poet, smiles
at her beloved in the highest heaven. More Apsarases than one are
occasionally spoken of. Their abode is in the later Vedas extended to
the earth, where they especially frequent trees, which resound with the
music of their lutes and cymbals. The Br&#257;hma&#7751;as describe
them as distinguished by great beauty and devoted to dance, song, and
play. In the post-Vedic period they become the courtesans of
Indra&rsquo;s heaven. The Apsarases are loved not only by the
Gandharvas but occasionally even by men. Such an one was
Urva&ccedil;&#299;. A dialogue between her and her earthly spouse,
Pur&#363;ravas, is contained in a somewhat obscure hymn of the
<i>Rigveda</i> (x. 95). The nymph is here made to say:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">Among mortals in other form I wandered,</p>
<p class="line">And dwelt for many nights throughout four autumns.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Her lover implores her to return; but, though his
request is refused, he (like Tithonus) receives the promise of
immortality. The <i>&Ccedil;atapatha Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i> tells the
story in a more connected and detailed form. Urva&ccedil;&#299; is
joined with Pur&#363;ravas in an alliance, the permanence of which
depends on a condition. When this is broken by a stratagem of the
Gandharvas, the nymph immediately vanishes from the sight of her lover.
Pur&#363;ravas, distracted, roams in search of her, till at last he
observes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>her swimming in a lotus lake with other
Apsarases in the form of an aquatic bird. Urva&ccedil;&#299; discovers
herself to him, and in response to his entreaties, consents to return
for once after the lapse of a year. This myth in the post-Vedic age
furnished the theme of K&#257;lid&#257;sa&rsquo;s play
<i>Vikramorva&ccedil;&#299;</i>.</p>
<p>Gandharva appears to have been conceived originally as a single
being. For in the <i>Rigveda</i> the name nearly always occurs in the
singular, and in the <i>Avesta</i>, where it is found a few times in
the form of Gandarewa, only in the singular. According to the
<i>Rigveda</i>, this genius, the lover of the water-nymph, dwells in
the fathomless spaces of air, and stands erect on the vault of heaven.
He is also a guardian of the celestial soma, and is sometimes, as in
the <i>Avesta</i>, connected with the waters. In the later Vedas the
Gandharvas form a class, their association with the Apsarases being so
frequent as to amount to a stereotyped phrase. In the post-Vedic age
they have become celestial singers, and the notion of their home being
in the realm of air survives in the expression &ldquo;City of the
Gandharvas&rdquo; as one of the Sanskrit names for
&ldquo;mirage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the numerous ancient priests and heroes of the <i>Rigveda</i>
the most important is Manu, the first sacrificer and the ancestor of
the human race. The poets refer to him as &ldquo;our father,&rdquo; and
speak of sacrificers as &ldquo;the people of Manu.&rdquo; The
<i>&Ccedil;atapatha Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i> makes Manu play the part of
a Noah in the history of human descent.</p>
<p>A group of ancient priests are the Angirases, who are closely
associated with Indra in the myth of the capture of the cows. Another
ancient race of mythical priests are the Bh&#7771;igus, to whom the
Indian Prometheus, M&#257;tari&ccedil;van, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>brought the hidden Agni from heaven, and whose
function was the establishment and diffusion of the sacrificial fire on
earth.</p>
<p>A numerically definite group of ancestral priests, rarely mentioned
in the <i>Rigveda</i>, are the seven Rishis or seers. In the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;as they came to be regarded as the seven stars in the
constellation of the Great Bear, and are said to have been bears in the
beginning. This curious identification was doubtless brought about
partly by the sameness of the number in the two cases, and partly by
the similarity of sound between <i>&#7771;ishi</i>, &ldquo;seer,&rdquo;
and <i>&#7771;iksha</i>, which in the <i>Rigveda</i> means both
&ldquo;star&rdquo; and &ldquo;bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Animals play a considerable part in the mythological and religious
conceptions of the Veda. Among them the horse is conspicuous as drawing
the cars of the gods, and in particular as representing the sun under
various names. In the Vedic ritual the horse was regarded as symbolical
of the sun and of fire. Two hymns of the <i>Rigveda</i> (i.
162&ndash;163) which deal with the subject, further show that
horse-sacrifice was practised in the earliest age of Indian
antiquity.</p>
<p>The cow, however, is the animal which figures most largely in the
<i>Rigveda</i>. This is undoubtedly due to the important position,
resulting from its pre-eminent utility, occupied by this animal even in
the remotest period of Indian life. The beams of dawn and the clouds
are cows. The rain-cloud, personified under the name of
P&#7771;i&ccedil;ni, &ldquo;the speckled one,&rdquo; is a cow, the
mother of the Storm-gods. The bountiful clouds on which all wealth in
India depended, were doubtless the prototypes of the many-coloured cows
which yield all desires in the heaven of the blest described by the
<i>Atharva-veda</i>, and which are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110"
href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>the forerunners of the
&ldquo;Cow of Plenty&rdquo; <i>(K&#257;maduh)</i> so familiar to
post-Vedic poetry. The earth itself is often spoken of by the poets of
the <i>Rigveda</i> as a cow. That this animal already possessed a
sacred character is shown by the fact that one Rishi addresses a cow as
Aditi and a goddess, impressing upon his hearers that she should not be
slain. <i>Aghny&#257;</i> (&ldquo;not to be killed&rdquo;), a frequent
designation of the cow in the <i>Rigveda</i>, points in the same
direction. Indeed the evidence of the <i>Avesta</i> proves that the
sanctity of this animal goes back even to the Indo-Iranian period. In
the <i>Atharva-veda</i> the worship of the cow is fully recognised,
while the <i>&Ccedil;atapatha Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i> emphasises the
evil consequences of eating beef. The sanctity of the cow has not only
survived in India down to the present day, but has even gathered
strength with the lapse of time. The part played by the greased
cartridges in the Indian Mutiny is sufficient to prove this statement.
To no other animal has mankind owed so much, and the debt has been
richly repaid in India with a veneration unknown in other lands. So
important a factor has the cow proved in Indian life and thought, that
an exhaustive account of her influence from the earliest times would
form a noteworthy chapter in the history of civilisation.</p>
<p>Among the noxious animals of the <i>Rigveda</i> the serpent is the
most prominent. This is the form which the powerful demon, the foe of
Indra, is believed to possess. The serpent also appears as a divine
being in the form of the rarely mentioned Ahi budhnya, &ldquo;the
Dragon of the Deep,&rdquo; supposed to dwell in the fathomless depths
of the a&euml;rial ocean, and probably representing the beneficent side
of the character of the serpent V&#7771;itra. In the later Vedas the
serpents are mentioned <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href=
"#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span>as a class of semi-divine beings
along with the Gandharvas and others; and in the S&#363;tras offerings
to them are prescribed. In the latter works we meet for the first time
with the N&#257;gas, in reality serpents, and human only in form. In
post-Vedic times serpent-worship is found all over India. Since there
is no trace of it in the <i>Rigveda</i>, while it prevails widely among
the non-Aryan Indians, there is reason to believe that when the Aryans
spread over India, the land of serpents, they found the cult diffused
among the aborigines and borrowed it from them.</p>
<p>Plants are frequently invoked as divinities, chiefly in enumerations
along with waters, rivers, mountains, heaven, and earth. One entire
hymn (x. 97) is, however, devoted to the praise of plants
(<i>oshadhi</i>) alone, mainly with regard to their healing powers.
Later Vedic texts mention offerings made to plants and the adoration
paid to large trees passed in marriage processions. One hymn of the
<i>Rigveda</i> (x. 146) celebrates the forest as a whole, personified
as Ara&#7751;y&#257;n&#299;, the mocking genius of the woods. The weird
sights and sounds of the gloaming are here described with a fine
perception of nature. In the dark solitudes of the jungle</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Sounds as of grazing cows are heard,</p>
<p class="line">A dwelling-house appears to loom,</p>

<p class="line">Creaks like a cart at eventide.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Here some one calls his cow to him,</p>
<p class="line">Another there is felling wood;</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="first">On the whole, however, the part played by plant, tree,
and forest deities is a very insignificant one in the
<i>Rigveda</i>.</p>
<p>A strange religious feature pointing to a remote antiquity is the
occasional deification and worship even of objects fashioned by the
hand of man, when regarded as useful to him. These are chiefly
sacrificial implements. Thus in one hymn (iii. 8) the sacrificial post
(called &ldquo;lord of the forest&rdquo;) is invoked, while three hymns
of the tenth book celebrate the pressing stones used in preparing soma.
The plough is invoked in a few stanzas; and an entire hymn (vi. 75) is
devoted to the praise of various implements of war, while one in the
<i>Atharva-veda</i> (v. 20) glorifies the drum.</p>
<p>The demons so frequently mentioned in the <i>Rigveda</i> are of two
classes. The one consists of the a&euml;rial adversaries of the gods.
The older view is that of a conflict waged between a single god and a
single demon. This gradually developed into the notion of the gods and
the demons in general being arrayed against each other as two opposing
hosts. The Br&#257;hma&#7751;as regularly represent the antagonism
thus. Asura is the ordinary name of the a&euml;rial foes of the gods.
This word has a remarkable history. In the <i>Rigveda</i> it is
predominantly a designation of the gods, and in the <i>Avesta</i> it
denotes, in the form of Ahura, the highest god of Zoroastrianism. In
the later parts of the <i>Rigveda</i>, however, <i>asura</i>, when used
by itself, also signifies &ldquo;demon,&rdquo; and this is its only
sense in the <i>Atharva-veda</i>. A somewhat unsuccessful <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>attempt has been made to explain how a word
signifying &ldquo;god&rdquo; came to mean &ldquo;devil,&rdquo; as the
result of national conflicts, the Asuras or gods of extra-Vedic tribes
becoming demons to the Vedic Indian, just as the <i>devas</i> or gods
of the Veda are demons in the <i>Avesta</i>. There is no traditional
evidence in support of this view, and it is opposed by the fact that to
the Rigvedic Indian <i>asura</i> not only in general meant a divine
being, but was especially appropriate to Varu&#7751;a, the most exalted
of the gods. The word must therefore have changed its meaning in course
of time within the Veda itself. Here it seems from the beginning to
have had the sense of &ldquo;possessor of occult power,&rdquo; and
hence to have been potentially applicable to hostile beings. Thus in
one hymn of the <i>Rigveda</i> (x. 124) both senses seem to occur.
Towards the end of the Rigvedic period the application of the word to
the gods began to fall into abeyance. This tendency was in all
likelihood accelerated by the need of a word denoting the hostile
demoniac powers generally, as well as by an incipient popular
etymology, which saw a negative (<i>a-sura</i>) in the word and led to
the invention of <i>sura</i>, &ldquo;god,&rdquo; a term first found in
the Upanishads.</p>
<p>A group of a&euml;rial demons, primarily foes of Indra, are the
Pa&#7751;is. The proper meaning of the word is &ldquo;niggard,&rdquo;
especially in regard to sacrificial gifts. From this signification it
developed the mythological sense of demons resembling those originally
conceived as withholding the treasures of heaven. The term
<i>d&#257;sa</i> or <i>dasyu</i>, properly the designation of the dark
aborigines of India contrasted with their fair Aryan conquerors, is
frequently used in the sense of demons or fiends.</p>
<p>By far the most conspicuous of the individual a&euml;rial
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>demons of the <i>Rigveda</i>, is V&#7771;itra,
who has the form of a serpent, and whose name means
&ldquo;encompasser.&rdquo; Another demon mentioned with some frequency
is Vala, the personification of the mythical cave in which the
celestial cows are confined. In post-Vedic literature these two demons
are frequently mentioned together and are regarded as brothers slain by
Indra. The most often named among the remaining adversaries of Indra is
&Ccedil;ush&#7751;a, the &ldquo;hisser&rdquo; or
&ldquo;scorcher.&rdquo; A rarely-mentioned demon is Svarbh&#257;nu, who
is described as eclipsing the sun with darkness. His successor in
Sanskrit literature was R&#257;hu, regarded as causing eclipses by
swallowing the sun or moon.</p>
<p>The second class of demons consists of goblins supposed to infest
the earth, enemies of mankind as the Asuras are of the gods. By far the
most common generic name for this class is Rakshas. They are hardly
ever mentioned except in connection with some god who is invoked to
destroy or is praised for having destroyed them. These goblins are
conceived as having the shapes of various animals as well as of men.
Their appearance is more fully described by the <i>Atharvaveda</i>, in
which they are also spoken of as deformed or as being blue, yellow, or
green in colour. According to the <i>Rigveda</i> they are fond of the
flesh of men and horses, whom they attack by entering into them in
order to satisfy their greed. They are supposed to prowl about at night
and to make the sacrifice the special object of their attacks. The
belief that the Rakshases actively interfere with the performance of
sacrificial rites remains familiar in the post-Vedic period. A species
of goblin scarcely referred to in the <i>Rigveda</i>, but often
mentioned in the later Vedas, are the Pi&ccedil;&#257;chas, described
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>as devouring corpses and closely connected with
the dead.</p>
<p>Few references to death and the future life are to be found in the
hymns of the <i>Rigveda</i>, as the optimistic and active Vedic Indian,
unlike his descendants in later centuries, seems to have given little
thought to the other world. Most of the information to be gained about
their views of the next life are to be found in the funeral hymns of
the last book. The belief here expressed is that fire or the grave
destroys the body only, while the real personality of the deceased is
imperishable. The soul is thought to be separable from the body, not
only after death, but even during unconsciousness (x. 58). There is no
indication here, or even in the later Vedas, of the doctrine of the
transmigration of souls, though it was already firmly established in
the sixth century B.C. when Buddhism arose. One passage of the
<i>Rigveda</i>, however, in which the soul is spoken of as departing to
the waters or the plants, may contain the germs of the theory.

<p class="first">According to the Vedic view, the spirit of the
deceased proceeded to the realm of eternal light on the path trodden by
the fathers, whom he finds in the highest heaven revelling with Yama,
king of the dead, and feasting with the gods.</p>
<p>In one of the funeral hymns (x. 14, 7) the dead man is thus
addressed:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">Go forth, go forth along those ancient pathways</p>
<p class="line">To where our early ancestors departed.</p>
<p class="line">There thou shalt see rejoicing in libations</p>
<p class="line">The two kings, Varu&#7751;a the god and Yama.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Here a tree spreads its branches, in the shade of
which Yama drinks soma with the gods, and the sound of the flute and of
songs is heard. The life in heaven is free from imperfections or bodily
frailties, and is altogether delectable. It is a glorified life of
material joys as conceived by the imagination, not of warriors, but of
priests. Heaven is gained as a reward by heroes who risk their lives in
battle, but above all by those who bestow liberal sacrificial gifts on
priests.</p>
<p>Though the <i>Atharva-veda</i> undoubtedly shows a belief in a place
of future punishment, the utmost that can be inferred with regard to
the <i>Rigveda</i> from the scanty evidence we possess, is the notion
that unbelievers were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href=
"#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>consigned to an underground
darkness after death. So little, indeed, do the Rishis say on this
subject, and so vague is the little they do say, that Roth held the
total annihilation of the wicked by death to be their belief. The early
Indian notions about future punishment gradually developed, till, in
the post-Vedic period, a complicated system of hells had been
elaborated.</p>
<p>Some passages of the <i>Rigveda</i> distinguish the path of the
fathers or dead ancestors from the path of the gods, doubtless because
cremation appeared as a different process from sacrifice. In the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;as the fathers and the gods are thought to dwell in
distinct abodes, for the &ldquo;heavenly world&rdquo; is contrasted
with the &ldquo;world of the fathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief of the blessed dead is Yama, to whom three entire hymns
are addressed. He is spoken of as a king who rules the departed and as
a gatherer of the people, who gives the deceased a resting-place and
prepares an abode for him. Yama it was who first discovered the way to
the other world:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">Him who along the mighty heights departed,</p>
<p class="line">Him who searched and spied out the path for many,</p>
<p class="line">Son of Vivasvat, gatherer of the people,</p>
<p class="line">Yama the king, with sacrifices worship. <span class=
"rm">(x. 14, 1).</span></p>
</div>
<p class="first">Though death is the path of Yama, and he must
consequently have been regarded with a certain amount of fear, he is
not yet in the <i>Rigveda</i>, as in the <i>Atharvaveda</i> and the
later mythology, a god of death. The owl and pigeon are occasionally
mentioned as emissaries of Yama, but his regular messengers are two
dogs which guard the path trodden by the dead proceeding to the other
world. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=

<p>With reference to them the deceased man is thus addressed in one of
the funeral hymns (x. 14):&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">

<p class="line">Broad-nosed and brown, the messengers of Yama,</p>
<p class="line">Greedy of lives, wander among the people:</p>
<p class="line">May they give back to us a life auspicious</p>
<p class="line">Here and to-day, that we may see the sunlight.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">The name of Yama is sometimes used in the
<i>Rigveda</i> in its primary sense of &ldquo;twin,&rdquo; and the
chief of the dead actually occurs in this character throughout a hymn
(x. 10) of much poetic beauty, consisting of a dialogue between him and
his sister Yam&#299;. She endeavours to win his love, but he repels her
advances with these words:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">The spies sent by the gods here ever wander,</p>
<p class="line">They stand not still, nor close their eyes in
slumber:</p>
<p class="line">Another man thine arms shall clasp, O Yam&#299;,</p>
<p class="line">Tightly as twines around the tree the creeper.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The incestuous union which forms the main theme of the
poem, though rejected as contrary to the higher ethical standard of the
<i>Rigveda</i>, was doubtless the survival of an already existing myth
of the descent of mankind from primeval &ldquo;twins.&rdquo; This myth,
indeed, seems to have been handed down from the Indo-Iranian period,
for the later Avestan literature makes mention of Yimeh as a sister of
Yima. Even the name of Yama&rsquo;s father goes back to that period,
for Yima is the son of Vivanhvant in the <i>Avesta</i> as Yama is of
Vivasvat in the <i>Rigveda</i>.</p>
<p>The great bulk of the Rigvedic poems comprises invocations
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>of gods or deified objects as described in the
foregoing pages. Scattered among them are to be found, chiefly in the
tenth book, about a dozen mythological pieces consisting of dialogues
which, in a vague and fragmentary way, indicate the course of the
action and refer to past events. In all likelihood they were originally
accompanied by a narrative setting in prose, which explained the
situation more fully to the audience, but was lost after these poems
were incorporated among the collected hymns of the <i>Rigveda</i>. One
of this class (iv. 42) is a colloquy between Indra and Varu&#7751;a, in
which each of these leading gods puts forward his claims to
pre-eminence. Another, which shows considerable poetic merit and
presents the situation clearly, is a dialogue in alternate verses
between Varu&#7751;a and Agni (x. 51), followed by a second (x. 52)
between the gods and Agni, who has grown weary of his sacrificial
office, but finally agrees to continue the performance of his
duties.</p>
<p>A curious but prosaic and obscure hymn (x. 86), consists of a
dialogue between Indra and his wife Indr&#257;&#7751;&#299; on the
subject of a monkey which has incurred the anger of the latter. The
circumstances are much more clearly presented in a poem of great beauty
(x. 108), in which Saram&#257;, the messenger of Indra, having tracked
the stolen cows, demands them back from the Pa&#7751;is. Another
already referred to (p. 107) treats the myth of Urva&ccedil;&#299; and
Pur&#363;ravas. The dialogue takes place at the moment when the nymph
is about to quit her mortal lover for ever. A good deal of interest
attaches to this myth, not only as the oldest Indo-European love-story,
but as one which has had a long history in Indian literature. The
dialogue of Yama and Yam&#299; (x. 10) is, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span>as
we have seen, based on a still older myth. These mythological ballads,
if I may use the expression, foreshadow the dramatic and epic poetry of
a later age.</p>
<p>A very small number, hardly more than thirty altogether, of the
hymns of the <i>Rigveda</i> are not addressed to the gods or deified
objects. About a dozen poems, occurring almost exclusively in the tenth
book, are concerned with magical notions, and therefore belong rather
to the domain of the <i>Atharva-veda</i>, Two short ones (ii.
42&ndash;43) belong to the sphere of augury, certain birds of omen
being invoked to utter auspicious cries. Two others consist of spells
directed against poisonous vermin (i. 191), and the disease called
<i>yakshma</i> (x. 163). Two are incantations to preserve the life of
one lying at the point of death (x. 58; 60, 7&ndash;12). A couple of
stanzas from one of the latter may serve as a specimen:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Just as a yoke with leathern thong</p>
<p class="line">They fasten on that it may hold:</p>
<p class="line">So have I now held fast thy soul,</p>
<p class="line">That thou mayst live and mayst not die,</p>
<p class="line">Anon to be unhurt and well.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Downward is blown the blast of wind,</p>
<p class="line">Downward the burning sunbeams shoot,</p>
<p class="line">Adown the milk streams from the cow:</p>
<p class="line">So downward may thy ailment go.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">Here is a stanza from a poem intended as a charm to
induce slumber (v. 55):&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">The man who sits and he who walks,</p>
<p class="line">And he who sees us with his gaze:</p>
<p class="line">Of these we now close up the eyes,</p>
<p class="line">Just as we shut this dwelling-house.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=

<p>The first three stanzas of this lullaby end with the refrain,
&ldquo;Fall fast asleep&rdquo; (<i>ni shu shvapa</i>).</p>
<p>The purpose of one incantation (x. 183) is to procure children,
while another (x. 162) is directed against the demon that destroys
offspring. There is also a spell (x. 166) aiming at the destruction of
enemies. We further find the incantation (x. 145) of a woman desiring
to oust her rival wives from the affections of her husband. A sequel to
it is formed by the song of triumph (x. 159) of one who has succeeded
in this object:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Up has arisen there the sun,</p>
<p class="line">So too my fortunes now arise:</p>

</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">My sons now mighty warriors are,</p>

<p class="first">With regard to a late hymn (vii. 103), which is
entirely secular in style, there is some doubt as to its original
purpose. The awakening of the frogs at the beginning of the rainy
season is here described with a graphic power which will doubtless be
appreciated best by those who have lived in India. The poet compares
the din of their croaking with the chants of priests exhilarated by
soma, and with the clamour of pupils at school repeating the words of
their teacher:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Resting in silence for a year,</p>
<p class="line">As Brahmans practising a vow, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">The frogs have lifted up their voice,</p>
<p class="line">Excited when Parjanya comes.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">When one repeats the utterance of the other</p>
<p class="line">Like those who learn the lesson of their teacher,</p>
<p class="line">Then every limb of yours seems to be swelling,</p>
<p class="line">As eloquent ye prate upon the waters.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">As Brahmans at the mighty soma offering</p>
<p class="line">Sit round the large and brimming vessel talking,</p>
<p class="line">So throng ye round the pool to hallow</p>
<p class="line">This day of all the year that brings the rain-time.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">These Brahmans with their soma raise their voices,</p>
<p class="line">Performing punctually their yearly worship;</p>
<p class="line">And these Adhvaryus, sweating with their kettles,</p>
<p class="line">These priests come forth to view, and none are
hidden.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">The twelvemonth&rsquo;s god-sent order they have
guarded,</p>
<p class="line">And never do these men neglect the season.</p>
<p class="line">When in the year the rainy time commences,</p>
<p class="line">Those who were heated kettles gain deliverance.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">This poem has usually been interpreted as a satire
upon the Brahmans. If such be indeed its purport, we find it difficult
to conceive how it could have gained admittance into a collection like
the <i>Rigveda</i>, which, if not entirely composed, was certainly
edited, by priests. The Brahmans cannot have been ignorant of the real
significance of the poem. On the other hand, the comparison of frogs
with Brahmans would not necessarily imply satire to the Vedic Indian.
Students familiar with the style of the <i>Rigveda</i> know that many
similes which, if used by ourselves, would involve contempt or
ridicule, were employed by the ancient Indian poets only for the sake
of graphic effect. As the frogs are in the last stanza besought to
grant wealth and length of days, it is much more likely that we have
here a panegyric of frogs believed to have the magical power of
bringing rain. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=
"pb123">123</a>]</span></p>
<p>There remain about twenty poems the subject-matter of which is of a
more or less secular character. They deal with social customs, the
liberality of patrons, ethical questions, riddles, and cosmogonic
speculations. Several of them are of high importance for the history of
Indian thought and civilisation. As social usages have always been
dominated by religion in India, it is natural that the poems dealing
with them should have a religious and mythological colouring. The most
notable poem of this kind is the long wedding-hymn (x. 85) of
forty-seven stanzas. Lacking in poetic unity, it consists of groups of
verses relating to the marriage ceremonial loosely strung together. The
opening stanzas (1&ndash;5), in which the identity of the celestial
soma and of the moon is expressed in veiled terms, are followed by
others (6&ndash;17) relating the myth of the wedding of Soma the moon
with the sun-maiden S&#363;ry&#257;. The A&ccedil;vins, elsewhere her
spouses, here appear in the inferior capacity of groomsmen, who, on
behalf of Soma, sue for the hand of S&#363;ry&#257; from her father,
the sun-god. Savit&#7771;i consents, and sends his daughter, a willing
bride, to her husband&rsquo;s house on a two-wheeled car made of the
wood of the <i>&ccedil;almali</i> or silk-cotton tree, decked with red
<i>kim&#803;&ccedil;uka</i> flowers, and drawn by two white bulls.</p>
<p>Then sun and moon, the prototype of human marriage, are described as
an inseparable pair (18&ndash;19):&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">They move alternately with mystic power;</p>
<p class="line">Like children playing they go round the sacrifice:</p>
<p class="line">One of the two surveys all living beings,</p>
<p class="line">The other, seasons meting out, is born again.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Ever anew, being born again, he rises,</p>
<p class="line">He goes in front of dawns as daylight&rsquo;s
token.</p>
<p class="line">He, coming, to the gods their share apportions:</p>
<p class="line">The moon extends the length of man&rsquo;s
existence.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span></p>
<p>Blessings are then invoked on the wedding procession, and a wish
expressed that the newly-married couple may have many children and
enjoy prosperity, long life, and freedom from disease
(20&ndash;33).</p>
<p>The next two stanzas (34&ndash;35), containing some obscure
references to the bridal garments, are followed by six others
(36&ndash;41) pronounced at the wedding rite, which is again brought
into connection with the marriage of S&#363;ry&#257;. The bridegroom
here thus addresses the bride:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">I grasp thy hand that I may gain good fortune,</p>
<p class="line">That thou may&rsquo;st reach old age with me thy
husband.</p>
<p class="line">Bhaga, Aryaman, Savit&#7771;i, Puram&#803;dhi,</p>
<p class="line">The gods have given thee to share my household.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The god of fire is at the same time
invoked:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">To thee, O Agni, first they led</p>
<p class="line">Bright S&#363;ry&#257; with the bridal throng:</p>
<p class="line">So in thy turn to husbands give</p>
<p class="line">A wife along with progeny.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The concluding verses (42&ndash;47) are benedictions
pronounced on the newly-wedded couple after the bride has arrived at
her future home:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">Here abide; be not divided;</p>
<p class="line">Complete life&rsquo;s whole allotted span,</p>
<p class="line">Playing with your sons and grandsons,</p>
<p class="line">Rejoicing in your own abode.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The last stanza of all is spoken by the
bridegroom:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">May all the gods us two unite,</p>
<p class="line">May Waters now our hearts entwine;</p>
<p class="line">May M&#257;tari&ccedil;van and Dh&#257;tri,</p>
<p class="line">May Desh&#7789;r&#299; us together join.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">There are five hymns, all in the last book (x.
14&ndash;18), which are more or less concerned with funeral rites.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>All but one of them, however, consist chiefly of
invocations of gods connected with the future life. The first (14) is
addressed to Yama, the next to the Fathers, the third to Agni, and the
fourth to P&#363;shan, as well as Sarasvat&#299;. Only the last (18) is
a funeral hymn in the true sense. It is secular in style as well as in
matter, being almost free from references to any of the gods. Grave and
elevated in tone, it is distinguished by great beauty of language. It
also yields more information about the funeral usages of those early
days than any of the rest.</p>
<p>From this group of hymns it appears that burial was practised as
well as cremation by the Vedic Indians. The composer of a hymn
addressed to Varu&#7751;a in Book VII. also mentions &ldquo;the house
of clay&rdquo; in connection with death. Cremation was, however, the
usual manner of disposing of the dead, and the later Vedic ritual
practically knew this method alone, sanctioning only the burial of
ascetics and children under two years of age. With the rite of
cremation, too, the mythological notions about the future life were
specially connected. Thus Agni conducts the corpse to the other world,
where the gods and Fathers dwell. A goat was sacrificed when the corpse
was burned, and this goat, according to the <i>Atharva-veda</i> (ix. 5,
1 and 3), preceded and announced the deceased to the fathers, just as
in the <i>Rigveda</i> the goat immolated with the sacrificial horse
goes before to announce the offering to the gods (i. 162&ndash;163). In
the later Vedic ritual a goat or cow was sacrificed as the body was
cremated.</p>
<p>In conformity with a custom of remotest antiquity still surviving in
India, the dead man was provided with ornaments and clothing for use in
the future life. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126"
name="pb126">126</a>]</span>The fact that in the funeral obsequies of
the <i>Rigveda</i> the widow lies down beside the body of her deceased
husband and his bow is removed from the dead man&rsquo;s hand, shows
that both were in earlier times burnt with his body to accompany him to
the next world, and a verse of the <i>Atharva-veda</i> calls the dying
of the widow with her husband an old custom. The evidence of
anthropology shows that this was a very primitive practice widely
prevailing at the funerals of military chiefs, and it can be proved to
go back to the Indo-European age.</p>
<p>The following stanza (8) from the last funeral hymn (x. 18) is
addressed to the widow, who is called upon to rise from the pyre and
take the hand of her new husband, doubtless a brother of the deceased,
in accordance with an ancient marriage custom:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">Rise up; come to the world of life; O woman;</p>
<p class="line">Thou liest here by one whose soul has left him.</p>
<p class="line">Come: thou hast now entered upon the wifehood</p>
<p class="line">Of this thy lord who takes thy hand and woos thee.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The speaker then, turning to the deceased man,
exclaims:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">From the dead hand I take the bow he wielded,</p>
<p class="line">To gain for us dominion, might, and glory.</p>

<p class="line">Will vanquish all assaults of every foeman.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Approach the bosom of the earth, the mother,</p>
<p class="line">This earth extending far and most propitious:</p>

<p class="line">Preserve thee from the lap of dissolution.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Open wide, O earth, press not heavily on him,</p>
<p class="line">Be easy of approach, hail him with kindly aid;</p>
<p class="line">As with a robe a mother hides</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=

<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">These living ones are from the dead divided:</p>
<p class="line">Our calling on the gods is now auspicious.</p>

</div>
<div class="lg">

<p class="line">As seasons duly alternate with seasons;</p>
<p class="line">As the later never forsakes the earlier,</p>
<p class="line">So fashion thou the lives of these, Ordainer.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">A few of the secular poems contain various historical
references. These are the so-called <i>D&#257;nastutis</i> or
&ldquo;Praises of Gifts,&rdquo; panegyrics commemorating the liberality
of princes towards the priestly singers employed by them. They possess
little poetic merit, and are of late date, occurring chiefly in the
first and tenth books, or among the <i>V&#257;lakhilya</i>
(supplementary) hymns of the eighth. A number of encomia of this type,
generally consisting of only two or three stanzas, are appended to
ordinary hymns in the eighth book and, much less commonly, in most of
the other books. Chiefly concerned in describing the kind and the
amount of the gifts bestowed on them, the composers of these panegyrics
incidentally furnish historical data about the families and genealogies
of themselves and their patrons, as well as about the names and homes
of the Vedic tribes. The amount of the presents bestowed&mdash;for
instance, 60,000 cows&mdash;is sometimes enormously exaggerated. We
may, however, safely conclude that it was often considerable, and that
the Vedic chiefs possessed very large herds of cattle.</p>
<p>Four of the secular poems are didactic in character. One of these
(x. 34), &ldquo;The Lament of the Gambler,&rdquo; strikes a pathetic
note. Considering that it is the oldest composition <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span>of
the kind in existence, we cannot but regard this poem as a most
remarkable literary product. The gambler deplores his inability to
throw off the spell of the dice, though he sees the ruin they are
bringing on him and his household:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Downward they fall, then nimbly leaping upward,</p>
<p class="line">They overpower the man with hands, though handless.</p>
<p class="line">Cast on the board like magic bits of charcoal,</p>
<p class="line">Though cold themselves, they burn the heart to
ashes.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">It pains the gambler when he sees a woman,</p>
<p class="line">Another&rsquo;s wife, and their well-ordered
household:</p>
<p class="line">He yokes these brown steeds early in the morning,</p>
<p class="line">And, when the fire is low, sinks down an outcast.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Play not with dice, but cultivate thy
cornfield;</p>
<p class="line">Rejoice in thy goods, deeming them abundant:</p>
<p class="line">There are thy cows, there is thy wife, O
gambler.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">This counsel Savit&#7771;i the kindly gives me.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">We learn here that the dice (<i>aksha</i>) were made
of the nut of the Vibh&#299;daka tree (<i>Terminalia bellerica</i>),
which is still used for the purpose in India.</p>
<p>The other three poems of this group may be regarded as the
forerunners of the sententious poetry which flourished so luxuriantly
in Sanskrit literature. One of them, consisting only of four stanzas
(ix. 112), describes in a moralising strain of mild humour how men
follow after gain in various ways:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">The thoughts of men are manifold,</p>
<p class="line">Their callings are of diverse kinds:</p>
<p class="line">The carpenter desires a rift,</p>
<p class="line">The leech a fracture wants to cure.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">A poet I; my dad&rsquo;s a leech;</p>
<p class="line">Mama the upper millstone grinds:</p>
<p class="line">With various minds we strive for wealth,</p>
<p class="line">As ever seeking after kine.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span></p>
<p>Another of these poems (x. 117) consists of a collection of maxims
inculcating the duty of well-doing and charity:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Who has the power should give unto the needy,</p>
<p class="line">Regarding well the course of life hereafter:</p>
<p class="line">Fortune, like two chariot wheels revolving,</p>
<p class="line">Now to one man comes nigh, now to another.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Ploughing the soil, the share produces nurture;</p>
<p class="line">He who bestirs his feet performs his journey;</p>
<p class="line">A priest who speaks earns more than one who&rsquo;s
silent;</p>
<p class="line">A friend who gives is better than the niggard.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">The fourth of these poems (x. 71) is composed in
praise of wise speech. Here are four of its eleven stanzas:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Where clever men their words with wisdom utter,</p>
<p class="line">And sift them as with flail the corn is winnowed,</p>
<p class="line">There friends may recognise each other&rsquo;s
friendship:</p>
<p class="line">A goodly stamp is on their speech imprinted.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Whoever his congenial friend abandons,</p>
<p class="line">In that man&rsquo;s speech there is not any
blessing.</p>
<p class="line">For what he hears he hears without advantage:</p>
<p class="line">He has no knowledge of the path of virtue.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">When Brahman friends unite to offer worship,</p>
<p class="line">In hymns by the heart&rsquo;s impulse swiftly
fashioned,</p>
<p class="line">Then not a few are left behind in wisdom,</p>
<p class="line">While others win their way as gifted Brahmans.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">The one sits putting forth rich bloom of verses,</p>
<p class="line">Another sings a song in skilful numbers,</p>
<p class="line">A third as teacher states the laws of being,</p>
<p class="line">A fourth metes out the sacrifice&rsquo;s measure.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">Even in the ordinary hymns are to be found a few
moralising remarks of a cynical nature about wealth and women, such as
frequently occur in the ethical literature of the post-Vedic age. Thus
one poet <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>exclaims: &ldquo;How many a maiden is an object
of affection to her wooer for the sake of her admirable wealth!&rdquo;
(x. 27, 12); while another addresses the kine he desires with the
words: &ldquo;Ye cows make even the lean man fat, even the ugly man ye
make of goodly countenance&rdquo; (vi. 28, 6). A third observes:
&ldquo;Indra himself said this, &lsquo;The mind of woman is hard to
instruct, and her intelligence is small&rsquo;&rdquo; (viii. 33, 17);
and a fourth complains: &ldquo;There are no friendships with women;
their hearts are those of hyenas&rdquo; (x. 95, 15). One, however,
admits that &ldquo;many a woman is better than the godless and
niggardly man&rdquo; (v. 61, 6).</p>
<p>Allied to the didactic poems are the riddles, of which there are at
least two collections in the <i>Rigveda</i>. In their simplest form
they are found in a poem (29) of the eighth book. In each of its ten
stanzas a different deity is described by his characteristic marks, but
without being mentioned, the hearer being left to guess his name.
Vish&#7751;u, for instance, is thus alluded to:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">Another with his mighty stride has made three steps</p>
<p class="line">To where the gods rejoice in bliss.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">A far more difficult collection, consisting of
fifty-two stanzas, occurs in the first book (164). Nothing here is
directly described, the language being always symbolical and mystical.
The allusions in several cases are so obscurely expressed that it is
now impossible to divine the meaning. Sometimes the riddle is put in
the form of a question, and in one case the answer itself is also
given. Occasionally the poet propounds a riddle of which he himself
evidently does not know the solution. In general these problems are
stated as enigmas. The subject of about one-fourth of them is the sun.
Six or seven deal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131"
name="pb131">131</a>]</span>with clouds, lightning, and the production
of rain; three or four with Agni and his various forms; about the same
number with the year and its divisions; two with the origin of the
world and the One Being. The dawn, heaven and earth, the metres,
speech, and some other subjects which can hardly even be conjectured,
are dealt with in one or two stanzas respectively. One of the more
clearly expressed of these enigmas is the following, which treats of
the wheel of the year with its twelve months and three hundred and
sixty days:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">Provided with twelve spokes and undecaying,</p>
<p class="line">The wheel of order rolls around the heavens;</p>
<p class="line">Within it stand, O Agni, joined in couples,</p>
<p class="line">Together seven hundred sons and twenty.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The thirteenth or intercalary month, contrasted with
the twelve others conceived as pairs, is thus darkly alluded to:
&ldquo;Of the co-born they call the seventh single-born; sages call the
six twin pairs god-born.&rdquo; The latter expression probably alludes
to the intercalary month being an artificial creation of man. In the
later Vedic age it became a practice to propound such enigmas, called
&ldquo;theological problems&rdquo; (<i>brahmodya</i>), in contests for
intellectual pre-eminence when kings instituted great sacrifices or
Brahmans were otherwise assembled together.</p>
<p>Closely allied to these poetical riddles is the philosophical poetry
contained in the six or seven cosmogonic hymns of the <i>Rigveda</i>.
The question of the origin of the world here treated is of course
largely mixed with mythological and theological notions. Though
betraying much confusion of ideas, these early speculations are of
great interest as the sources from which flow various streams of later
thought. Most of these hymns handle <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb132" href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>the subject of the
origin of the world in a theological, and only one in a purely
philosophical spirit. In the view of the older Rishis, the gods in
general, or various individual deities, &ldquo;generated&rdquo; the
world. This view conflicts with the frequently expressed notion that
heaven and earth are the parents of the gods. The poets thus involve
themselves in the paradox that the children produce their own parents.
Indra, for instance, is described in so many words as having begotten
his father and mother from his own body (x. 54, 3). This conceit
evidently pleased the fancy of a priesthood becoming more and more
addicted to far-fetched speculations; for in the cosmogonic hymns we
find reciprocal generation more than once introduced in the stages of
creation. Thus Daksha is said to have sprung from Aditi, and Aditi from
Daksha (x. 72, 4).</p>
<p>The evolution of religious thought in the <i>Rigveda</i> led to the
conception of a creator distinct from any of the chief deities and
superior to all the gods. He appears under the various names of
Purusha, Vi&ccedil;vakarman, Hira&#7751;yagarbha, or Praj&#257;pati in
the cosmogonic hymns. Whereas creation, according to the earlier view,
is regularly referred to as an act of natural generation with some form
of the verb <i>jan</i>, &ldquo;to beget,&rdquo; these cosmogonic poems
speak of it as the manufacture or evolution from some original
material. In one of them (x. 90), the well-known Hymn of Man
(<i>purusha-s&#363;kta</i>), the gods are still the agents, but the
material out of which the world is made consists of the body of a
primeval giant, Purusha (man), who being thousand-headed and
thousand-footed, extends even beyond the earth, as he covers it. The
fundamental idea of the world being created from the body of a giant
is, indeed, very ancient, being met with <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb133" href="#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span>in several primitive
mythologies. But the manner in which the idea is here worked out is
sufficiently late. Quite in the spirit of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as,
where Vish&#7751;u is identified with the sacrifice, the act of
creation is treated as a sacrificial rite, the original man being
conceived as a victim, the parts of which when cut up become portions
of the universe. His head, we are told, became the sky, his navel the
air, his feet the earth, while from his mind sprang the moon, from his
eye the sun, from his breath the wind. &ldquo;Thus they (the gods)
fashioned the worlds.&rdquo; Another sign of the lateness of the hymn
is its pantheistic colouring; for it is here said that &ldquo;Purusha
is all this world, what has been and shall be,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;one-fourth of him is all creatures, and three-fourths are the
world of the immortals in heaven.&rdquo; In the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as,
Purusha is the same as the creator, Praj&#257;pati, and in the
Upanishads he is identified with the universe. Still later, in the
dualistic S&#257;nkhya philosophy, Purusha becomes the name of
&ldquo;soul&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;matter.&rdquo; In the Hymn of
Man a being called Vir&#257;j is mentioned as produced from Purusha.
This in the later Ved&#257;nta philosophy is a name of the personal
creator as contrasted with Brahma, the universal soul. The Purusha
hymn, then, may be regarded as the oldest product of the pantheistic
literature of India. It is at the same time one of the very latest
poems of the Rigvedic age; for it presupposes a knowledge of the three
oldest Vedas, to which it refers together by name. It also for the
first and only time in the <i>Rigveda</i> mentions the four castes; for
it is here said that Purusha&rsquo;s mouth became the Brahman, his arms
the R&#257;janya (warrior), his thighs the Vai&ccedil;ya
(agriculturist), and his feet the &Ccedil;&#363;dra (serf).</p>
<p>In nearly all the other poems dealing with the origin <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>of
the world, not the gods collectively but an individual creator is the
actor. Various passages in other hymns show that the sun was regarded
as an important agent of generation by the Rishis. Thus he is described
as &ldquo;the soul of all that moves and stands&rdquo; (i. 115, 1), and
is said to be &ldquo;called by many names though one&rdquo; (i. 164,
46). Such statements indicate that the sun was in process of being
abstracted to the character of a creator. This is probably the origin
of Vi&ccedil;vakarman, &ldquo;the all-creating,&rdquo; to whom two
cosmogonic hymns (x. 81&ndash;82) are addressed. Three of the seven
stanzas of the first deserve to be quoted:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">What was the place on which he gained a footing?</p>
<p class="line">Where found he anything, or how, to hold by,</p>

philosophy to express &ldquo;original matter&rdquo;
(<i>h&#363;l&#275;</i>).</p>

produced the first germ of things, the source of the universe and the

the creator further appears under the name of Hira&#7751;yagarbha,

the germ of all life.</p>

<p>The refrain receives its answer in a tenth stanza (added to the poem
at a later time), which proclaims the unknown god to be
Praj&#257;pati.</p>
<p>Two other cosmogonic poems explain the origin of the world
philosophically as the evolution of the existent (<i>sat</i>) from the
non-existent (<i>asat</i>). In the somewhat confused account given in
one of them (x. 72), three stages of creation may be distinguished:
first the world is produced, then the gods, and lastly the sun. The
theory of evolution is here still combined with that of
creation:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">Apart from its high literary merit, this poem is most
noteworthy for the daring speculations which find utterance in so
remote an age. But even here may be traced some of the main defects of
Indian philosophy&mdash;lack of clearness and consistency, with a
tendency to make reasoning depend on mere words. Being the only piece
of sustained speculation in the <i>Rigveda</i>, it is the
starting-point of the natural philosophy which assumed shape in the
evolutionary S&#257;nkhya system. It will, moreover, always retain a
general interest as the earliest specimen of Aryan philosophic thought.
With the theory of the Song of Creation, that after the non-existent
had developed into the existent, water came first, and then
intelligence was evolved from it by heat, the cosmogonic accounts of
the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as substantially agree. Here, too, the
non-existent becomes the existent, of which the first form is the
waters. On these floats Hira&#7751;yagarbha, the cosmic golden egg,
whence is produced the spirit that desires and creates the universe.
Always requiring the agency of the creator Praj&#257;pati at an earlier
or a later stage, the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as in some of their accounts
place him first, in others the waters. This fundamental contradiction,
due to mixing up the theory of creation with that of evolution, is
removed in the S&#257;nkhya system by causing Purusha, or soul, to play
the part of a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>passive spectator, while <i>Prak&#7771;iti</i>,
or primordial matter, undergoes successive stages of development. The
cosmogonic hymns of the <i>Rigveda</i> are not only thus the precursors
of Indian philosophy, but also of the Pur&#257;&#7751;as, one of the
main objects of which is to describe the origin of the world.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The survey of the poetry of the <i>Rigveda</i>
presented in the foregoing pages will perhaps suffice to show that this
unique monument of a long-vanished age contains, apart from its
historical interest, much of &aelig;sthetic value, and well deserves to
be read, at least in selections, by every lover of literature. The
completeness of the picture it supplies of early religious thought has
no parallel. Moreover, though its purely secular poems are so few, the
incidental references contained in the whole collection are
sufficiently numerous to afford material for a tolerably detailed
description of the social condition of the earliest Aryans in India.
Here, then, we have an additional reason for attaching great importance
to the <i>Rigveda</i> in the history of civilisation.</p>
<p>In the first place, the home of the Vedic tribes is revealed to us
by the geographical data which the hymns yield. From these we may
conclude with certainty that the Aryan invaders, after having descended
into the plains, in all probability through the western passes of the
Hindu Kush, had already occupied the north-western corner of India
which is now called by the Persian name of Panj&#257;b, or &ldquo;Land
of Five Rivers.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3929src" href=
"#xd21e3929" name="xd21e3929src">1</a> Mention is made in the hymns of
some twenty-five <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140"
name="pb140">140</a>]</span>streams, all but two or three of which
belong to the Indus river system. Among them are the five which water
the territory of the Panj&#257;b, and, after uniting in a single
stream, flow into the Indus. They are the Vitast&#257; (now Jhelum),
the Asikn&#299; (Chenab), the Parush&#7751;&#299; (later called
Ir&#257;vat&#299;, &ldquo;the refreshing,&rdquo; whence its present
name, Ravi), the Vip&#257;&ccedil; (Be&auml;s), and the largest and
most easterly, the &Ccedil;utudr&#299; (Sutlej). Some of the Vedic
tribes, however, still remained on the farther side of the Indus,
occupying the valleys of its western tributaries, from the Kubh&#257;
(Kabul), with its main affluent to the north, the Suv&#257;stu, river
&ldquo;of fair dwellings&rdquo; (now Swat), to the Krumu (Kurum) and
Gomat&#299;, &ldquo;abounding in cows&rdquo; (now Gomal), farther
south.</p>
<p>Few of the rivers of the <i>Rigveda</i> are mentioned more than two
or three times in the hymns, and several of them not more than once.
The only names of frequent occurrence are those of the Indus and the
Sarasvat&#299;. One entire hymn (x. 75) is devoted to its laudation,
but eighteen other streams, mostly its tributaries, share its praises
in two stanzas. The mighty river seems to have made a deep impression
on the mind of the poet. He speaks of her as the swiftest of the swift,
surpassing all other streams in volume of water. Other rivers flow to
her as lowing cows hasten to their calf. The roar and rush of her
waters are described in enthusiastic strains:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">From earth the sullen roar swells upward to the
sky,</p>
<p class="line">With brilliant spray she dashes up unending surge;</p>
<p class="line">As when the streams of rain pour thund&rsquo;ring from
the cloud,</p>
<p class="line">The Sindhu onward rushes like a bellowing bull.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The Sindhu (now Sindh), which in Sanskrit simply means
<i>the</i> &ldquo;river,&rdquo; as the western boundary of the Aryan
settlements, suggested to the nations of antiquity <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>which first came into contact with them in that
quarter a name for the whole peninsula. Adopted in the form of
<i>Indos</i>, the word gave rise to the Greek appellation <i>India</i>
as the country of the Indus. It was borrowed by the ancient Persians as
<i>Hindu</i>, which is used in the <i>Avesta</i> as a name of the
country itself. More accurate is the modern Persian designation
<i>Hindustan</i>, &ldquo;land of the Indus,&rdquo; a name properly
applying only to that part of the peninsula which lies between the
Him&#257;laya and Vindhya ranges.</p>
<p>Mention is often made in the <i>Rigveda</i> of the <i>sapta
sindhavah&#803;</i>, or &ldquo;seven rivers,&rdquo; which in one
passage at least is synonymous with the country inhabited by the Aryan
Indians. It is interesting to note that the same expression <i>hapta
hindu</i> occurs in the <i>Avesta</i>, though it is there restricted to
mean only that part of the Indian territory which lay in Eastern
Kabulistan. If &ldquo;seven&rdquo; is here intended for a definite
number, the &ldquo;seven rivers&rdquo; must originally have meant the
Kabul, the Indus, and the five rivers of the Panj&#257;b, though later
the Sarasvat&#299; may have been substituted for the Kabul. For the
Sarasvat&#299; is the sacred river of the <i>Rigveda</i>, more
frequently mentioned, generally as a goddess, and lauded with more
fervour than any other stream. The poet&rsquo;s descriptions are often
only applicable to a large river. Hence Roth and other distinguished
scholars concluded that Sarasvat&#299; is generally used by the poets
of the <i>Rigveda</i> simply as a sacred designation of the Indus. On
the other hand, the name in a few passages undoubtedly means the small
river midway between the Sutlej and the Jumna, which at a later period
formed, with the D&#7771;ishadvat&#299;, the eastern boundary of the
sacred region called Brahm&#257;varta, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb142" href="#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>lying to the south of
Amb&#257;la, and commencing some sixty miles south of Simla.</p>
<p>This small river now loses itself in the sands of the desert, but
the evidence of ancient river-beds appears to favour the conclusion
that it was originally a tributary of the &Ccedil;utudr&#299; (Sutlej).
It is therefore not improbable that in Vedic times it reached the sea,
and was considerably larger than it is now. Considering, too, the
special sanctity which it had already acquired, the laudations supposed
to be compatible only with the magnitude of the Indus may not have
seemed too exaggerated when applied to the lesser stream. It is to be
noted that the D&#7771;ishadvat&#299;, the &ldquo;stony&rdquo; (now
Ghogra or Ghugger), in the only passage in which the name occurs in the
<i>Rigveda</i>, is associated with the Sarasvat&#299;, Agni being
invoked to flame on the banks of these rivers. This is perhaps an
indication that even in the age of the <i>Rigveda</i> the most easterly
limit of the Indus river system had already acquired a certain sanctity
as the region in which the sacrificial ritual and the art of sacred
poetry were practised in the greatest perfection. There are indications
showing that by the end at least of the Rigvedic period some of the
Aryan invaders had passed beyond this region and had reached the
western limit of the Gangetic river system. For the Yamun&#257; (now
Jumna), the most westerly tributary of the Ganges in the north, is
mentioned in three passages, two of which prove that the Aryan
settlements already extended to its banks. The Ganges itself is already
known, for its name is mentioned directly in one passage of the
<i>Rigveda</i> and indirectly in another. It is, however, a noteworthy
fact that the name of the Ganges is not to be found in any of the other
Vedas. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span></p>
<p>The southward migration of the Aryan invaders does not appear to
have extended, at the time when the hymns of the <i>Rigveda</i> were
composed, much beyond the point where the united waters of the
Panj&#257;b flow into the Indus. The ocean was probably known only from
hearsay, for no mention is made of the numerous mouths of the Indus,
and fishing, one of the main occupations on the banks of the Lower
Indus at the present day, is quite ignored. The word for fish
(<i>matsya</i>), indeed, only occurs once, though various kinds of
animals, birds, and insects are so frequently mentioned. This accords
with the character of the rivers of the Panj&#257;b and Eastern
Kabulistan, which are poor in fish, while it contrasts with the
intimate knowledge of fishing betrayed by the <i>Yajurveda</i>, which
was composed when the Aryans had spread much farther to the east, and,
doubtless, also to the south. The word which later is the regular name
for &ldquo;ocean&rdquo; (<i>sam-udra</i>), seems therefore, in
agreement with its etymological sense (&ldquo;collection of
waters&rdquo;), to mean in the <i>Rigveda</i> only the lower course of
the Indus, which, after receiving the waters of the Panj&#257;b, is so
wide that a boat in mid-stream is invisible from the bank. It has been
noted in recent times that the natives in this region speak of the
river as the &ldquo;sea of Sindh;&rdquo; and indeed the word
<i>sindhu</i> (&ldquo;river&rdquo;) itself in several passages of the
<i>Rigveda</i> has practically the sense of &ldquo;sea.&rdquo;
Metaphors such as would be used by a people familiar with the ocean are
lacking in the <i>Rigveda</i>. All references to navigation point only
to the crossing of rivers in boats impelled by oars, the main object
being to reach the other bank (<i>p&#257;ra</i>). This action suggested
a favourite figure, which remained familiar throughout Sanskrit
literature. Thus one of the poets of the <i>Rigveda</i> invokes Agni
with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>the words, &ldquo;Take us across all woes and
dangers as across the river (<i>sindhu</i>) in a boat;&rdquo; and in
the later literature one who has accomplished his purpose or mastered
his subject is very frequently described as &ldquo;having reached the
farther shore&rdquo; (<i>p&#257;raga</i>). The <i>Atharva-veda</i>, on
the other hand, contains some passages showing that its composers were
acquainted with the ocean.</p>
<p>Mountains are constantly mentioned in the <i>Rigveda</i>, and rivers
are described as flowing from them. The Him&#257;laya (&ldquo;abode of
snow&rdquo;) range in general is evidently meant by the
&ldquo;snowy&rdquo; (<i>himavantah&#803;</i>) mountains which are in
the keeping of the Creator. But no individual peak is mentioned with
the exception of M&#363;javat, which is indirectly referred to as the
home of Soma. This peak, it is to be inferred from later Vedic
literature, was situated close to the Kabul Valley, and was probably
one of the mountains to the south-west of Kashmir. The
<i>Atharva-veda</i> also mentions two other mountains of the
Him&#257;laya. One of these is called Trikakud, the
&ldquo;three-peaked&rdquo; (in the later literature Trik&#363;&#7789;a,
and even now Trik&#333;ta), through the valley at the foot of which
flows the Asikn&#299; (Chenab). The other is
N&#257;vaprabhram&#803;&ccedil;ana (&ldquo;sinking of the ship&rdquo;),
doubtless identical with the Naubandhana (&ldquo;binding of the
ship&rdquo;) of the epic and the Manoravasarpa&#7751;a of the
<i>&Ccedil;atapatha Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>, on which the ship of Manu
is said to have rested when the deluge subsided. The <i>Rigveda</i>
knows nothing of the Vindhya range, which divides Northern India from
the southern triangle of the peninsula called the Dekhan;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4075src" href="#xd21e4075" name="xd21e4075src">2</a>
nor does it mention the Narmad&#257; River (now Nerbudda), <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span>which flows immediately south of and parallel to
that range.</p>
<p>From these data it may safely be concluded that the Aryans, when the
hymns of the <i>Rigveda</i> were composed, had overspread that portion
of the north-west which appears on the map as a fan-shaped territory,
bounded on the west by the Indus, on the east by the Sutlej, and on the
north by the Him&#257;laya, with a fringe of settlements extending
beyond those limits to the east and the west. Now the Panj&#257;b of
the present day is a vast arid plain, from which, except in the
north-west corner at Rawal Pindi, no mountains are visible, and over
which no monsoon storms break. Here there are no grand displays of the
strife of the elements, but only gentle showers fall during the rainy
season, while the phenomena of dawn are far more gorgeous than
elsewhere in the north. There is, therefore, some probability in the
contention of Professor Hopkins, that only the older hymns, such as
those to Varu&#7751;a and Ushas, were composed in the Panj&#257;b
itself, while the rest arose in the sacred region near the
Sarasvat&#299;, south of the modern Amb&#257;la, where all the
conditions required by the <i>Rigveda</i> are found. This is more
likely than the assumption that the climate of the Panj&#257;b has
radically changed since the age of the Vedic poets.</p>
<p>That the home of the Aryans in the age of the <i>Rigveda</i> was the
region indicated is further borne out by the information the poems
yield about the products of the country, its flora and fauna. Thus the
soma, the most important plant of the <i>Rigveda</i>, is described as
growing on the mountains, and must have been easily obtainable, as its
juice was used in large quantities for the daily ritual. In the period
of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as it was brought from long <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=
"pb146">146</a>]</span>distances, or substitutes had to be used on
account of its rarity. Thus the identity of the original plant came to
be lost in India. The plant which is now commonly used is evidently
quite another, for its juice when drunk produces a nauseating effect,
widely different from the feeling of exhilaration dwelt on by the poets
of the <i>Rigveda</i>. Nor can the plant which the Parsis still import
from Persia for the Haoma rite be identical with the old soma. Again,
rice, which is familiar to the later Vedas and regarded in them as one
of the necessaries of life, is not mentioned in the <i>Rigveda</i> at
all. Its natural habitat is in the south-east, the regular monsoon
area, where the rainfall is very abundant. Hence it probably did not
exist in the region of the Indus river system when the <i>Rigveda</i>
was composed, though, in later times, with the practice of irrigation,
its cultivation spread to all parts of India. Corn (<i>yava</i>) was
grown by the tillers of the <i>Rigveda</i>, but the term is probably
not restricted, as later, to the sense of barley.</p>
<p>Among large trees mentioned in the <i>Rigveda</i>, the most
important is the A&ccedil;vattha (&ldquo;horse-stand&rdquo;) or sacred
fig-tree (<i>Ficus religiosa</i>). Its fruit (<i>pippala</i>) is
described as sweet and the food of birds. Its sacredness is at least
incipient, for its wood was used for soma vessels, and, as we learn
from the <i>Atharva-veda</i>, also for the drill (later-called
<i>pramantha</i>) employed in producing the sacred fire. The latter
Veda further tells us that the gods are seated in the third heaven
under an A&ccedil;vattha, which may indeed have been intended in the
<i>Rigveda</i> itself by the &ldquo;tree with fair foliage,&rdquo; in
whose shade the blessed revel with Yama. This tree, now called Peepal,
is still considered so sacred that a Hindu would be afraid to utter a
falsehood beside it. But the <i>Rigveda</i> does not mention at
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>all, and the <i>Atharva-veda</i> only twice, the
tree which is most characteristic of India, and shades with its
wide-spreading foliage a larger area than any other tree on the face of
the earth&mdash;the Nyagrodha (&ldquo;growing downwards&rdquo;) or
banyan (<i>Ficus indica</i>). With its lofty dome of foliage
impenetrable to the rays of the sun and supported by many lesser trunks
as by columns, this great tree resembles a vast temple of verdure
fashioned by the hand of Nature. What the village oak is in England,
that and much more is the banyan to the dwellers in the innumerable
hamlets which overspread the face of agricultural India.</p>
<p>Among wild animals, one of the most familiar to the poets of the
<i>Rigveda</i> is the lion (<i>sim&#803;ha</i>). They describe him as
living in wooded mountains and as caught with snares, but the
characteristic on which they chiefly dwell is his roaring. In the vast
desert to the east of the Lower Sutlej and of the Indus, the only part
of India suited for its natural habitat, the lion was in ancient times
no doubt frequent, but he now survives only in the wooded hills to the
south of the peninsula of Gujarat. The king of beasts has, however,
remained conventionally familiar in Indian literature, and his old
Sanskrit designation is still common in Hindu names in the form of
Singh.</p>
<p>The tiger is not mentioned in the <i>Rigveda</i> at all, its natural
home being the swampy jungles of Bengal, though he is now found in all
the jungly parts of India. But in the other Vedas he has decidedly
taken the place of the lion, which is, however, still known. His
dangerous character as a beast of prey is here often referred to. Thus
the <i>White Yajurveda</i> compares a peculiarly hazardous undertaking
with waking a sleeping tiger; and the <i>Atharva-veda</i> describes the
animal as &ldquo;man <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148"
name="pb148">148</a>]</span>eating&rdquo; (<i>purush&#257;d</i>). The
relation of the tiger to the lion in the Vedas therefore furnishes
peculiarly interesting evidence of the eastward migration of the Aryans
during the Vedic period.</p>
<p>Somewhat similar is the position of the elephant. It is explicitly
referred to in only two passages of the <i>Rigveda</i>, and the form of
the name applied to it, &ldquo;the beast (<i>m&#7771;iga</i>) with a
hand (<i>hastin</i>),&rdquo; shows that the Rishis still regarded it as
a strange creature. One passage seems to indicate that by the end of
the Rigvedic period attempts were made to catch the animal. That the
capture of wild elephants had in any case become a regular practice by
300 B.C. is proved by the evidence of Megasthenes. To the
<i>Atharva</i>- and the <i>Yajur-vedas</i> the elephant is quite
familiar, for it is not only frequently mentioned, but the adjective
<i>hastin</i>, &ldquo;possessing a hand&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> trunk), has
become sufficiently distinctive to be used by itself to designate the
animal. The regular home of the elephant in Northern India is the Terai
or lowland jungle at the foot of the Him&#257;laya, extending eastward
from about the longitude of Cawnpore.</p>
<p>The wolf (<i>v&#7771;ika</i>) is mentioned more frequently in the
<i>Rigveda</i> than the lion himself, and there are many references to
the boar (<i>var&#257;ha</i>), which was hunted with dogs. The buffalo
(<i>mahisha</i>), in the tame as well as the wild state, was evidently
very familiar to the poets, who several times allude to its flesh being
cooked and eaten. There is only one reference to the bear
(<i>&#7771;iksha</i>). The monkey (<i>kapi</i>) is only mentioned in a
late hymn (x. 86), but in such a way as to show that the animal had
already been tamed. The later and ordinary Sanskrit name for monkey,
<i>v&#257;nara</i> (&ldquo;forest-animal&rdquo;), has survived in the
modern vernaculars, and is known to readers of Mr. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>Rudyard Kipling in the form of <i>Bunder-log</i>
(&ldquo;monkey-people&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Among the domestic animals known to the <i>Rigveda</i> those of
lesser importance are sheep, goats, asses, and dogs. The latter, it may
be gathered, were used for hunting, guarding, and tracking cattle, as
well as for keeping watch at night. Cattle, however, occupy the chief
place. Cows were the chief form of wealth, and the name of the
sacrificial &ldquo;fee,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4232src"
href="#xd21e4232" name="xd21e4232src">3</a> <i lang=
"sa-latn">dakshi&#7751;&#257;</i>, is properly an adjective meaning
&ldquo;right,&rdquo; &ldquo;valuable,&rdquo; with the ellipse of
<i>go</i>, &ldquo;cow.&rdquo; No sight gladdened the eye of the Vedic
Indian more than the cow returning from the pasture and licking her
calf fastened by a cord; no sound was more musical to his ear than the
lowing of milch kine. To him therefore there was nothing grotesque in
the poet exclaiming, &ldquo;As cows low to their calves near the
stalls, so we will praise Indra with our hymns,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Like
unmilked kine we have called aloud (lowed) to thee, O hero
(Indra).&rdquo; For greater security cows were, after returning from
pasture, kept in stalls during the night and let out again in the
morning. Though the cow-killer is in the <i>White Yajurveda</i> already
said to be punishable with death, the <i>Rigveda</i> does not express
an absolute prohibition, for the wedding-hymn shows that even the cow
was slaughtered on specially solemn occasions, while bulls are several
times described as sacrificed to Indra in large numbers. Whilst the
cows were out at pasture, bulls and oxen were regularly used for the
purpose of ploughing and drawing carts.</p>
<p>Horses came next in value to cattle, for wealth in steeds is
constantly prayed for along with abundance of cows. To a people so
frequently engaged in battle, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150"
href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span>the horse was of essential
value in drawing the war-car; he was also indispensable in the
chariot-race, to which the Vedic Indian was devoted. He was, however,
not yet used for riding. The horse-sacrifice, moreover, was regarded as
the most important and efficacious of animal sacrifices.</p>
<p>Of the birds of the <i>Rigveda</i> I need only mention those which
have some historical or literary interest. The wild goose or swan
(<i>ham&#803;sa</i>), so familiar to the classical poets, is frequently
referred to, being said to swim in the water and to fly in a line. The
curious power of separating soma from water is attributed to it in the
<i>White Yajurveda</i>, as that of extracting milk from water is in the
later poetry. The latter faculty belongs to the curlew (<i>krunch</i>),
according to the same Veda.</p>
<p>The <i>chakrav&#257;ka</i> or ruddy goose, on the fidelity of which
the post-Vedic poets so often dwell, is mentioned once in the
<i>Rigveda</i>, the A&ccedil;vins being said to come in the morning
like a couple of these birds, while the <i>Atharva-veda</i> already
refers to them as models of conjugal love. Peahens
(<i>may&#363;r&#299;</i>) are spoken of in the <i>Rigveda</i> as
removing poison, and parrots (<i>&ccedil;uka</i>) are alluded to as
yellow. By the time of the <i>Yajurveda</i> the latter bird had been
tamed, for it is there described as &ldquo;uttering human
speech.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A good illustration of the dangers of the <i>argumentum ex
silentio</i> is furnished by the fact that salt, the most necessary of
minerals, is never once mentioned in the <i>Rigveda</i>. And yet the
Northern Panj&#257;b is the very part of India where it most abounds.
It occurs in the salt range between the Indus and the Jhelum in such
quantities that the Greek companions of Alexander, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>according to Strabo, asserted the supply to be
sufficient for the wants of the whole of India.</p>
<p>Among the metals, gold is the one most frequently mentioned in the
<i>Rigveda</i>. It was probably for the most part obtained from the
rivers of the north-west, which even at the present day are said to
yield considerable quantities of the precious metal. Thus the Indus is
spoken of by the poets as &ldquo;golden&rdquo; or &ldquo;having a
golden bed.&rdquo; There are indications that kings possessed gold in
abundance. Thus one poet praises his royal benefactor for bestowing ten
nuggets of gold upon him besides other bountiful gifts. Gold ornaments
of various kinds, such as ear-rings and armlets, are often
mentioned.</p>
<p>The metal which is most often referred to in the <i>Rigveda</i> next
to gold is called <i>ayas</i> (Latin, <i>aes</i>). It is a matter of no
slight historical interest to decide whether this signifies
&ldquo;iron&rdquo; or not. In most passages where it occurs the word
appears to mean simply &ldquo;metal.&rdquo; In the few cases where it
designates a particular metal, the evidence is not very conclusive; but
the inference which may be drawn as to its colour is decidedly in
favour of its having been reddish, which points to bronze and not iron.
The fact that the <i>Atharva-veda</i> distinguishes between
&ldquo;dark&rdquo; <i>ayas</i> and &ldquo;red,&rdquo; seems to indicate
that the distinction between iron and copper or bronze had only
recently been drawn. It is, moreover, well known that in the progress
of civilisation the use of bronze always precedes that of iron. Yet it
would be rash to assert that iron was altogether unknown even to the
earlier Vedic age. It seems quite likely that the Aryans of that period
were unacquainted with silver, for its name is not mentioned in the
<i>Rigveda</i>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152"
name="pb152">152</a>]</span>and the knowledge of silver goes hand in
hand with that of iron, owing to the manner in which these metals are
intermingled in the ore which produces them. These two metals,
moreover, are not found in any quantity in the north-west of India.</p>
<p>The evidence of the topography, the climate, and the products of the
country thus shows that the people by whose poets the <i>Rigveda</i>
was composed were settled in the north-west of India, from the Kabul to
the Jumna. But they were still engaged in conflict with the aborigines,
for many victories over them are referred to. Thus Indra is said to
have bound 1000 or slain 30,000 of them for his allies. That the
conquerors were bent on acquiring new territory appears from the rivers
being frequently mentioned as obstacles to farther advance. The
invaders, though split up into many tribes, were conscious of a unity
of race and religion. They styled themselves &#256;ryas or
&ldquo;kinsmen,&rdquo; as opposed to the aborigines, to whom they gave
the name of <i>Dasyu</i> or <i>D&#257;sa</i>, &ldquo;fiends,&rdquo; in
later times also called <i>an&#257;rya</i>, or non-Aryans. The
characteristic physical difference between the two races was that of
colour (<i>var&#7751;a</i>), the aborigines being described as
&ldquo;black&rdquo; (<i>k&#7771;ish&#7751;a</i>) or
&ldquo;black-skins,&rdquo; and as the &ldquo;D&#257;sa colour,&rdquo;
in contrast with the &ldquo;Aryan colour&rdquo; or &ldquo;our
colour.&rdquo; This contrast undoubtedly formed the original basis of
caste, the regular name for which in Sanskrit is
&ldquo;colour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those of the conquered race who did not escape to the hills and were
captured became slaves. Thus one singer receives from his royal patron
a hundred asses, a hundred sheep, and a hundred D&#257;sas. The latter
word in later Sanskrit regularly means servant or slave, much in the
same way as &ldquo;captive Slav&rdquo; to the German <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span>came
to mean &ldquo;slave.&rdquo; When thoroughly subjected, the original
inhabitants, ceasing to be called Dasyus, became the fourth caste under
the later name of &Ccedil;&#363;dras. The Dasyus are described in the
<i>Rigveda</i> as non-sacrificing, unbelieving, and impious. They are
also doubtless meant by the phallus-worshippers mentioned in two
passages. The Aryans in course of time came to adopt this form of cult.
There are several passages in the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> showing
that &Ccedil;iva was already venerated under the emblem of the phallus
when that epic was composed. Phallus-worship is widely diffused in
India at the present day, but is most prevalent in the south. The
Dasyus appear to have been a pastoral race, for they possessed large
herds, which were captured by the victorious Aryans. They fortified
themselves in strongholds (called <i>pur</i>), which must have been
numerous, as Indra is sometimes said to have destroyed as many as a
hundred of them for his allies.</p>
<p>The <i>Rigveda</i> mentions many tribes among the Aryans. The most
north-westerly of these are the Gandh&#257;ris, who, judged by the way
they are referred to, must have been breeders of sheep. They were later
well known as Gandh&#257;ras or G&#257;ndh&#257;ras. The
<i>Atharva-veda</i> mentions as contiguous to the Gandh&#257;ris the
M&#363;javats, a tribe doubtless settled close to Mount M&#363;javat;
evidently regarding these two as the extreme limit of the Aryan
settlements to the north-west.</p>
<p>The most important part, if not the whole, of the Indian Aryans is
meant by the &ldquo;five tribes,&rdquo; an expression of frequent
occurrence in the <i>Rigveda</i>. It is not improbable that by this
term were meant five tribes which are enumerated together in two
passages, the P&#363;rus, Turva&ccedil;as, Yadus, Anus, and Druhyus.
These <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>are often mentioned as engaged in intertribal
conflicts. Four of them, along with some other clans, are named as
having formed a coalition under ten kings against Sud&#257;s, chief of
the T&#7771;itsus. The opposing forces met on the banks of the
Parush&#7751;&#299;, where the great &ldquo;battle of the ten
kings&rdquo; was fought. The coalition, in their endeavours to cross
the stream and to deflect its course, were repulsed with heavy loss by
the T&#7771;itsus.</p>
<p>The P&#363;rus are described as living on both banks of the
Sarasvat&#299;. A part of them must, however, have remained behind
farther west, as they were found on the Parush&#7751;&#299; in
Alexander&rsquo;s time. The <i>Rigveda</i> often mentions their king,
Trasadasyu, son of Purukutsa, and speaks of his descendant
T&#7771;ikshi as a powerful prince. The Turva&ccedil;as are one of the
most frequently named of the tribes. With them are generally associated
the Yadus, among whom the priestly family of the Ka&#7751;vas seems to
have lived. It is to be inferred from one passage of the <i>Rigveda</i>
that the Anus were settled on the Parush&#7751;&#299;, and the priestly
family of the Bh&#7771;igus, it would appear, belonged to them. Their
relations to the Druhyus seem to have been particularly close. The
Matsyas, mentioned only in one passage of the <i>Rigveda</i>, were also
foes of the T&#7771;itsus. In the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> we find
them located on the western bank of the Yamun&#257;.</p>
<p>A more important name among the enemies of Sud&#257;s is that of the
Bharatas. One hymn (iii. 33) describes them as coming to the rivers
Vip&#257;&ccedil; and &Ccedil;utudr&#299; accompanied by
Vi&ccedil;v&#257;mitra, who, as we learn from another hymn (iii. 53),
had formerly been the chief priest of Sud&#257;s, and who now made the
waters fordable for the Bharatas by his prayers. This is probably the
occasion on which, according to another hymn (vii. 33), the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span>Bharatas were defeated by Sud&#257;s and his
T&#7771;itsus, who were aided by the invocations of Vasish&#7789;ha,
the successor and rival of Vi&ccedil;v&#257;mitra. The Bharatas appear
to be specially connected with sacrificial rites in the <i>Rigveda</i>;
for Agni receives the epithet <i>Bh&#257;rata</i>, &ldquo;belonging to
the Bharatas,&rdquo; and the ritual goddess Bh&#257;rat&#299;,
frequently associated with Sarasvat&#299;, derives her name from them.
In a hymn to Agni (iii. 23), mention is made of two Bharatas named
Deva&ccedil;ravas and Devav&#257;ta who kindled the sacred fire on the
D&#7771;ishadvat&#299;, the &#256;pay&#257;, and the Sarasvat&#299;,
the very region which is later celebrated as the holy land of
Brahmanism under the names of Brahm&#257;varta and Kurukshetra. The
family of the Ku&ccedil;ikas, to whom Vi&ccedil;v&#257;mitra belonged,
was closely connected with the Bharatas.</p>
<p>The T&#7771;itsus appear to have been settled somewhere to the east
of the Parush&#7751;&#299;, on the left bank of which Sud&#257;s may be
supposed to have drawn up his forces to resist the coalition of the ten
kings attempting to cross the stream from the west. Five tribes, whose
names do not occur later, are mentioned as allied with Sud&#257;s in
the great battle. The S&#7771;injayas were probably also confederates
of the T&#7771;itsus, being, like the latter, described as enemies of
the Turva&ccedil;as.</p>
<p>Of some tribes we learn nothing from the <i>Rigveda</i> but the
name, which, however, survives till later times. Thus the
U&ccedil;&#299;naras, mentioned only once, were, at the period when the
<i>Aitareya Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i> was composed, located in the middle
of Northern India; and the Chedis, also referred to only once, are
found in the epic age settled in Magadha (Southern Behar). Krivi, as a
tribal name connected with the Indus and Asikn&#299;, points to the
north-west. In the <i>&Ccedil;atapatha Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i> it is
stated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>to be the old name of the Panch&#257;las, who
inhabited the country to the north of the modern Delhi.</p>
<p>The <i>Atharva-veda</i> mentions as remote tribes not only the
Gandh&#257;ris and M&#363;javats, but also the Magadhas (Behar) and the
Angas (Bengal). We may therefore conclude that by the time that Veda
was completed the Aryans had already spread to the Delta of the
Ganges.</p>
<p>The Panch&#257;las are not mentioned in either Veda, and the name of
the Kurus is only found there indirectly in two or three compounds or
derivatives. They are first referred to in the <i>White Yajurveda</i>;
yet they are the two most prominent peoples of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a
period. On the other hand, the names of a number of the most important
of the Rigvedic tribes, such as the P&#363;rus, Turva&ccedil;as, Yadus,
T&#7771;itsus, and others, have entirely or practically disappeared
from the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as. Even the Bharatas, though held in high
regard by the composers of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as, and set up by them
as models of correct conduct, appear to have ceased to represent a
political entity, for there are no longer any references to them in
that sense, as to other peoples of the day. Their name, moreover, does
not occur in the tribal enumerations of the <i>Aitareya
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i> and of <i>Manu</i>, while it is practically
altogether ignored in the Buddhistic literature.</p>
<p>Such being the case, it is natural to suppose that the numerous
Vedic tribes, under the altered conditions of life in vast plains,
coalesced into nations with new names. Thus the Bharatas, to whom
belonged the royal race of the Kurus in the epic, and from whom the
very name of the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>, which describes the
great war of the Kurus, is derived, were doubtless absorbed in what
came to be called the Kuru nation. In the genealogical <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>system of the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> the
P&#363;rus are brought into close connection with the Kurus. This is
probably an indication that they too had amalgamated with the latter
people. It is not unlikely that the T&#7771;itsus, whose name
disappears after the <i>Rigveda</i>, also furnished one of the elements
of the Kuru nation.</p>
<p>As to the Panch&#257;las, we have seen that they represent the old
Krivis. It is, however, likely that the latter combined with several
small tribes to make up the later nation. A Br&#257;hma&#7751;a passage
contains an indication that the Turva&ccedil;as may have been one of
these. Perhaps the Yadus, generally associated with the Turva&ccedil;as
in the <i>Rigveda</i>, were also one of them. The epic still preserves
the name, in the patronymic form of Y&#257;dava, as that of the race in
which K&#7771;ish&#7751;a was born. The name of the Panch&#257;las
itself (derived from <i>pancha</i>, five) seems to indicate that this
people consisted of an aggregate of five elements.</p>
<p>Some of the tribes mentioned in the <i>Rigveda</i>, however,
maintained their individual identity under their old names down to the
epic period. These were the U&ccedil;&#299;naras, S&#7771;injayas,
Matsyas, and Chedis.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the <i>Rigveda</i> refers to a rich
and powerful prince called Ikshv&#257;ku. In the epic this name recurs
as that of a mighty king who ruled to the east of the Ganges in the
city of Ayodhy&#257; (Oudh) and was the founder of the Solar race.</p>
<p>It is clear from what has been said that the Vedic Aryans were split
up into numerous tribes, which, though conscious of their unity in
race, language, and religion, had no political cohesion. They
occasionally formed coalitions, it is true, but were just as often at
war with one another. The tribe, in fact, was the political unit,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span>organised much in the same way as the Afghans
are at the present day, or the Germans were in the time of Tacitus. The
tribe (<i>jana</i>) consisted of a number of settlements
(<i>vi&ccedil;</i>), which again were formed of an aggregate of
villages (<i>gr&#257;ma</i>). The fighting organisation of the tribe
appears to have been based on these divisions. The houses forming the
village seem to have been built entirely of wood, as they still were in
the time of Megasthenes. In the midst of each house the domestic fire
burnt. For protection against foes or inundations, fortified enclosures
(called <i>pur</i>) were made on eminences. They consisted of
earthworks strengthened with a stockade, or occasionally with stone.
There is nothing to show that they were inhabited, much less that
<i>pur</i> ever meant a town or city, as it did in later times.</p>
<p>The basis of Vedic society being the patriarchal family, the
government of the tribe was naturally monarchical. The king
(<i>r&#257;ja</i>) was often hereditary. Thus several successive
members of the same family are mentioned as rulers of the T&#7771;itsus
and of the P&#363;rus. Occasionally, however, the king was elected by
the districts (<i>vi&ccedil;</i>) of the tribe; but whether the choice
was then limited to members of the royal race, or was extended to
certain noble families, does not appear. In times of peace the main
duty of the king was to ensure the protection of his people. In return
they rendered him obedience, and supplied him with voluntary
gifts&mdash;not fixed taxes&mdash;for his maintenance. His power was by
no means absolute, being limited by the will of the people expressed in
the tribal assembly (<i>samiti</i>). As to the constitution and
functions of the latter, we have unfortunately little or no
information. In war, the king <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159"
href="#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>of course held the chief
command. On important occasions, such as the eve of a battle, it was
also his duty to offer sacrifice on behalf of his tribe, either
performing the rites himself, or employing a priest to do so.</p>
<p>Every tribe doubtless possessed a family of singers who attended the
king, praising his deeds as well as composing hymns to accompany the
sacrifice in honour of the gods. Depending on the liberality of their
patrons, these poets naturally did not neglect to lay stress on the
efficacy of their invocations, and on the importance of rewarding them
well for their services. The priest whom a king appointed to officiate
for him was called a <i>purohita</i> or domestic chaplain.
Vasish&#7789;ha occupied that position in the employ of King
Sud&#257;s; and in one of his hymns (vii. 33) he does not fail to point
out that the victory of the T&#7771;itsus was due to his prayers. The
panegyrics on liberal patrons contain manifest exaggerations, partly,
no doubt, intended to act as an incentive to other princes.
Nevertheless, the gifts in gold, cows, horses, chariots, and garments
bestowed by kings on their chief priests must often have been
considerable, especially after important victories. Under the later
Brahmanic hierarchy liberality to the priestly caste became a duty,
while the amount of the sacrificial fee was fixed for each particular
rite.</p>
<p>The employment of Purohitas by kings as their substitutes in the
performance of sacrificial functions is to be regarded as the beginning
and the oldest form of the priesthood in India. It became the
starting-point of the historically unique hierarchical order in which
the sacerdotal caste occupied the supreme position in society, and the
State was completely merged in the Church. Such, indeed, was the ideal
of the Catholic Church in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160"
href="#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>West during the Middle Ages,
but it never became an accomplished fact in Europe, as it did in India.
No sooner had the priesthood become hereditary than the development of
a caste system began, which has had no parallel in any other country.
But during the period represented by Sud&#257;s and Vasish&#7789;ha, in
which the older portion of the <i>Rigveda</i> was composed, the
priesthood was not yet hereditary, still less had the warrior and
sacerdotal classes became transformed into castes among the Aryan
tribes settled in the Panj&#257;b. This is confirmed by the fact that
in the epic age the inhabitants of Madhyade&ccedil;a or Mid-land, where
the Brahmanic caste system grew up, regarded the people of the
north-west as semi-barbarians.</p>
<p>In the simple social organisation of the Vedic tribes of this
region, where occupations were but little differentiated, every man was
a soldier as well a civilian, much as among the Afghans of to-day. As
they moved farther to the east, society became more complex, and
vocations tended to become hereditary. The population being now spread
over wider tracts of territory, the necessity arose for something in
the nature of a standing army to repel sudden attacks or quell risings
of the subject aborigines. The nucleus would have been supplied by the
families of the chiefs of lesser tribes which had amalgamated under
some military leader. The agricultural and industrial part of the
population were thus left to follow their pursuits without
interruption. Meanwhile the religious ceremonial was increasing in
complexity; its success was growing more dependent on correct
performance, while the preservation of the ancient hymns was becoming
more urgent. The priests had, therefore, to devote all their time and
energies <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=
"pb161">161</a>]</span>to the carrying out of their religious duties
and the handing down of the sacred tradition in their families.</p>
<p>Owing to these causes, the three main classes of Aryan society
became more and more separated. But how were they transformed into
castes or social strata divided from one another by the impassable
barriers of heredity and the prohibition of intermarrying or eating
together? This rigid mutual exclusiveness must have started, in the
first instance, from the treatment of the conquered aborigines, who, on
accepting the Aryan belief, were suffered to form a part of the Aryan
polity in the capacity of a servile class. The gulf between the two
races need not have been wider than that which at the present day, in
the United States, divides the whites from the negroes. When the latter
are described as men of &ldquo;colour,&rdquo; the identical term is
used which, in India, came to mean &ldquo;caste.&rdquo; Having become
hereditary, the sacerdotal class succeeded in securing a position of
sanctity and inviolability which raised them above the rest of the
Aryans as the latter were raised above the D&#257;sas. When their
supremacy was established, they proceeded to organise the remaining
classes in the state on similar lines of exclusiveness. To the time
when the system of the three Aryan castes, with the &Ccedil;&#363;dras
added as a fourth, already existed in its fundamental principles,
belong the greater part of the independent portions of the
<i>Yajurveda</i>, a considerable part of the <i>Atharva-veda</i> (most
of books viii. to xiii.), but of the <i>Rigveda</i>, besides the one
(x. 90) which distinctly refers to the four castes by name, only a few
of the latest hymns of the first, eighth, and tenth books. The word
<i>br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>, the regular name for &ldquo;man of the
first caste,&rdquo; is still rare in the <i>Rigveda</i>, occurring only
eight times, while <i>brahman</i>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162"
href="#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>which simply means sage or
officiating priest, is found forty-six times.</p>
<p>We may now pass on to sketch rapidly the social conditions which
prevailed in the period of the <i>Rigveda</i>. The family, in which
such relationships as a wife&rsquo;s brother and a husband&rsquo;s
brother or sister had special names, was clearly the foundation of
society. The father was at its head as &ldquo;lord of the house&rdquo;
(<i>g&#7771;ihapati</i>). Permission to marry a daughter was asked from
him by the suitor through the mediation of an intimate friend. The
wedding was celebrated in the house of the bride&rsquo;s parents,
whither the bridegroom, his relatives, and friends came in procession.
Here they were entertained with the flesh of cows slain in honour of
the occasion. Here, too, the bridegroom took the bride&rsquo;s hand and
led her round the nuptial fire. The <i>Atharva-veda</i> adds that he
set down a stone on the ground, asking the bride to step upon it for
the obtainment of offspring. On the conclusion of the wedding
festivities, the bride, anointed and in festal array, mounted with her
husband a car adorned with red flowers and drawn by two white bulls. On
this she was conducted in procession to her new home. The main features
of this nuptial ceremony of 3000 years ago still survive in India.</p>
<p>Though the wife, like the children, was subject to the will of her
husband, she occupied a position of greater honour in the age of the
<i>Rigveda</i> than in that of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as, for she
participated with her husband in the offering of sacrifice. She was
mistress of the house (<i>g&#7771;ihapatn&#299;</i>), sharing the
control not only of servants and slaves, but also of the unmarried
brothers and sisters of her husband. From the <i>Yajurveda</i> we learn
that it was customary for sons and daughters <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span>to
marry in the order of their age, but the <i>Rigveda</i> more than once
speaks of girls who remained unmarried and grew old in their
father&rsquo;s house. As the family could only be continued in the male
line, abundance of sons is constantly prayed for, along with wealth in
cattle and land, and the newly wedded husband hopes that his bride may
become a mother of heroes. Lack of sons was placed on the same level as
poverty, and adoption was regarded as a mere makeshift. No desire for
the birth of daughters is ever expressed in the <i>Rigveda</i>; their
birth is deprecated in the <i>Atharva-veda</i>, and the
<i>Yajurveda</i> speaks of girls being exposed when born. Fathers, even
in the earliest Vedic times, would doubtless have sympathised with the
sentiment of the <i>Aitareya Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>, that &ldquo;to
have a daughter is a misery.&rdquo; This prejudice survives in India to
the present day with unabated force.</p>
<p>That the standard of morality was comparatively high may be inferred
from the fact that adultery and rape were counted among the most
serious offences, and illegitimate births were concealed.</p>
<p>One or two passages indicate that the practice of exposing old men,
found among many primitive peoples, was not unknown to the
<i>Rigveda</i>.</p>
<p>Among crimes, the commonest appears to have been robbery, which
generally took the form of cattle-lifting, mostly practised at night.
Thieves and robbers are often mentioned, and the <i>Rigveda</i>
contains many prayers for protection at home, abroad, and on journeys.
Such criminals, when caught, were punished by being tied to stakes with
cords. Debts (<i>&#7771;i&#7751;a</i>) were often incurred, chiefly, it
would seem, at play, and the <i>Rigveda</i> even speaks of paying them
off by instalments. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164"
name="pb164">164</a>]</span></p>
<p>From the references to dress which the <i>Rigveda</i> contains we
may gather that a lower garment and a cloak were worn. Clothes were
woven of sheep&rsquo;s wool, were often variegated, and sometimes
adorned with gold. Necklets, bracelets, anklets, and ear-rings are
mentioned in the way of ornaments. The hair was anointed and combed.
The <i>Atharva-veda</i> even mentions a comb with a hundred teeth, and
also speaks of remedies which strengthened or restored the growth of
the hair. Women plaited their hair, while men occasionally wore it
braided and wound like a shell. The gods Rudra and P&#363;shan are
described as being thus adorned; and the Vasish&#7789;has, we learn,
wore their hair braided on the right side of the head. On festive
occasions wreaths were worn by men. Beards were usual, but shaving was
occasionally practised. The <i>Atharva-veda</i> relates how, when the
ceremony of shaving off his beard was performed on King Soma, V&#257;yu
brought the hot water and Savit&#7771;i skilfully wielded the
razor.</p>
<p>The chief article of food was milk, which was either drunk as it
came from the cow or was used for cooking grain as well as mixing with
soma. Next in importance came clarified butter (<i>gh&#7771;ita</i>,
now <i>ghee</i>), which, as a favourite food of men, was also offered
to the gods. Grain was eaten after being parched, or, ground to flour
between millstones, was made into cakes with milk or butter. Various
kinds of vegetables and fruit also formed part of the daily fare of the
Vedic Indian. Flesh was eaten only on ceremonial occasions, when
animals were sacrificed. Bulls being the chief offerings to the gods,
beef was probably the kind of meat most frequently eaten. Horse-flesh
must have been less commonly used, owing <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb165" href="#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span>to the comparative
rarity of the horse-sacrifice. Meat was either roasted on spits or
cooked in pots. The latter were made of metal or earthenware; but
drinking-vessels were usually of wood.</p>
<p>The Indians of the <i>Rigveda</i> were acquainted with at least two
kinds of spirituous liquor. Soma was the principal one. Its use was,
however, restricted to occasions of a religious character, such as
sacrifices and festivals. The genuine soma plant from which it was made
also became increasingly difficult to obtain as the Aryans moved
farther away from the mountains. The spirit in ordinary use was called
<i>sur&#257;</i>. The knowledge of it goes back to a remote period, for
its name, like that of soma, is found in the <i>Avesta</i> in the form
of <i>hura</i>. It was doubtless prepared from some kind of grain, like
the liquor made from rice at the present day in India. Indulgence in
<i>sur&#257;</i> went hand in hand with gambling. One poet mentions
anger, dice, and <i>sur&#257;</i> as the causes of various sins; while
another speaks of men made arrogant with <i>sur&#257;</i> reviling the
gods. Its use must have been common, for by the time of the
<i>V&#257;jasaneyi Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i>, the occupation of a
&ldquo;maker of sur&#257;&rdquo; (<i>sur&#257;k&#257;ra</i>) or
distiller had become a profession.</p>
<p>One of the chief occupations of the Vedic Indians was of course
warfare. They fought either on foot or on chariots. The latter had two
occupants, the fighter and the driver. This was still the case in the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>, where we find K&#7771;ish&#7751;a acting
as charioteer to Arjuna. Cavalry is nowhere mentioned, and probably
came into use at a considerably later period. By the time of
Alexander&rsquo;s invasion, however, it formed one of the regular four
divisions of the Indian army. There <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb166" href="#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>are some indications
that riding on horseback was at least known to the <i>Rigveda</i>, and
distinct references to it occur in the <i>Atharva</i>- and the
<i>Yajur-vedas</i>. The Vedic warriors were protected with coats of
mail and helmets of metal. The principal weapons were the bow and
arrow, the latter being tipped with poisoned horn or with a metal
point. Spears and axes are also frequently mentioned.</p>
<p>The principal means of livelihood to the Vedic Indian was
cattle-breeding. His great desire was to possess large herds; and in
the numerous prayers for protection, health, and prosperity, cattle are
nearly always mentioned first.</p>
<p>The Vedic Aryans were, however, not merely a pastoral people. They
had brought with them from beyond the valleys of Afghanistan at least a
primitive knowledge of agriculture, as is shown by the Indians and
Iranians having such terms as &ldquo;to plough&rdquo;
(<i>k&#7771;ish</i>) in common. This had, indeed, by the time of the
<i>Rigveda</i>, become an industry second only to cattle-breeding in
importance. The plough, which we learn from the <i>Atharva-veda</i> had
a metal share, was used for making furrows in the fields, and was drawn
by bulls. When the earth was thus prepared, seed was strewn over the
soil. Irrigation seems not to have been unknown, as dug-out channels
for water are mentioned. When ripe, the corn (<i>yava</i>) was cut with
a sickle. It was then laid in bundles on the threshing-floor, where it
was threshed out and finally sifted by winnowing.</p>
<p>Though the Vedic Indians were already a pastoral and agricultural
people, they still practised hunting to a considerable extent. The
hunter pursued his game with bow and arrow, or used traps and snares.
Birds <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>were usually caught with toils or nets spread on
the ground. Lions were taken in snares, antelopes secured in pits, and
boars hunted with dogs.</p>
<p>Navigation in Rigvedic times was, as we have already seen, limited
to the crossing of rivers. The boats (called <i>nau-s</i>, Greek
<i>nau-s</i>) were propelled by what were doubtless paddles
(<i>aritra</i>), and must have been of the most primitive type,
probably dug-out tree-trunks. No mention is made of rudder or anchor,
masts, or sails.</p>
<p>Trade in those days consisted in barter, the cow being the pecuniary
standard by which the value of everything was measured. The transition
to coinage was made by the use of gold ornaments and jewelry as a form
of reward or payment, as was the case among the ancient Germans. Thus
<i>nishka</i>, which in the <i>Rigveda</i> means a necklet, in later
times became the name of a coin.</p>
<p>Though the requirements of life in early Vedic times were still
primitive enough to enable every man more or less to supply his own
wants, the beginnings of various trades and industries can be clearly
traced in the <i>Rigveda</i>. References are particularly frequent to
the labour of the worker in wood, who was still carpenter, joiner, and
wheelwright in one. As the construction of chariots and carts required
peculiar skill, we find that certain men already devoted themselves to
it as a special art, and worked at it for pay. Hence felicity in the
composition of hymns is often compared with the dexterity of the
wheelwright. Mention is also sometimes made of the smith who smelts the
ore in a forge, using the wing of a bird instead of a bellows to
produce a draught. He is described as making kettles as well as other
domestic utensils of metal. The <i>Rigveda</i> also refers to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>tanners and the skins of animals prepared by
them. Women, it appears, were acquainted with sewing and with the
plaiting of mats from grass or reeds. An art much more frequently
alluded to in metaphors and similes is that of weaving, but the
references are so brief that we obtain no insight into the process. The
<i>Atharva-veda</i>, however, gives some details in a passage which
describes how Night and Day, personified as two sisters, weave the web
of the year alternately with threads that never break or come to an
end. The division of labour had been greatly developed by the time of
the <i>White Yajurveda</i>, in which a great many trades and vocations
are enumerated. Among these we find the rope-maker, the jeweller, the
elephant-keeper, and the actor.</p>
<p>Among the active and warlike Vedic Aryans the chariot-race was a
favourite amusement, as is shown by the very metaphors which are
borrowed from this form of sport. Though skilful driving was still a
highly esteemed art in the epic period, the use of the chariot both for
war and for racing gradually died out in Hindustan, partly perhaps
owing to the enervating influence of the climate, and partly to the
scarcity of horses, which had to be brought from the region of the
Indus.</p>
<p>The chief social recreation of men when they met together was
gambling with dice. The irresistible fascination exercised, and the
ruin often entailed by this amusement, we have already found described
in the Gambler&rsquo;s Lament. Some haunted the gaming-hall to such an
extent that we find them jocularly described in the <i>Yajurveda</i> as
&ldquo;pillars of the playhouse&rdquo;
(<i>sabh&#257;sth&#257;&#7751;u</i>). No certain information can be
gathered from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>the <i>Rigveda</i> as to how the game was
played. We know, however, from one passage that four dice were used.
The <i>Yajurveda</i> mentions a game played with five, each of which
has a name. Cheating at play appears in the <i>Rigveda</i> as one of
the most frequent of crimes; and one poet speaks of dice as one of the
chief sources of sinning against the ordinances of Varu&#7751;a. Hence
the word used in the <i>Rigveda</i> for &ldquo;gamester&rdquo;
(<i>kitava</i>) in classical Sanskrit came to mean &ldquo;cheat,&rdquo;
and a later word for &ldquo;rogue&rdquo; (<i>dh&#363;rta</i>) is used
as a synonym of &ldquo;gamester.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another amusement was dancing, which seems to have been indulged in
by men as well as women. But when the sex of the dancers is distinctly
referred to, they are nearly always maidens. Thus the Goddess of Dawn
is compared to a dancer decked in gay attire. That dancing took place
in the open air may be gathered from the line (x. 76, 6), &ldquo;thick
dust arose as from men who dance&rdquo;
(<i>n&#7771;ityat&#257;m</i>).</p>
<p>Various references in the <i>Rigveda</i> show that even in that
early age the Indians were acquainted with different kinds off music.
For we find the three main types of percussion, wind, and stringed
instruments there represented by the drum (<i>dundubhi</i>), the flute
(<i>v&#257;&#7751;a</i>), and the lute (<i>v&#299;&#7751;&#257;</i>).
The latter has ever since been the favourite musical instrument of the
Indians down to the present day. That the Vedic Indians were fond of
instrumental music may be inferred from the statement of a Rishi that
the sound of the flute is heard in the abode of Yama, where the blessed
dwell. From one of the S&#363;tras we learn that instrumental music was
performed at some religious rites, the <i>v&#299;&#7751;&#257;</i>
being played at the sacrifice to the Manes. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name="pb170">170</a>]</span>By
the time of the <i>Yajurveda</i> several kinds of professional
musicians appear to have arisen, for lute-players, drummers,
flute-players, and conch-blowers are enumerated in its list of
callings. Singing is, of course, very often mentioned in the
<i>Rigveda</i>. That vocal music had already got beyond the most
primitive stage may be concluded from the somewhat complicated method
of chanting the <i>S&#257;maveda</i>, a method which was probably very
ancient, as the Soma ritual goes back to the Indo-Iranian age.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of the three later Vedas, the <i>S&#257;maveda</i> is
much the most closely connected with the <i>Rigveda</i>. Historically
it is of little importance, for it contains hardly any independent
matter, all its verses except seventy-five being taken directly from
the <i>Rigveda</i>. Its contents are derived chiefly from the eighth
and especially the ninth, the Soma book. The <i>S&#257;maveda</i>
resembles the <i>Yajurveda</i> in having been compiled exclusively for
ritual application; for the verses of which it consists are all meant
to be chanted at the ceremonies of the soma sacrifice. Removed from
their context in the <i>Rigveda</i>, they are strung together without
internal connection, their significance depending solely on their
relation to particular rites. In form these stanzas appear in the text
of the <i>S&#257;maveda</i> as if they were to be spoken or recited,
differing from those of the <i>Rigveda</i> only in the way of marking
the accent. The <i>S&#257;maveda</i> is, therefore, only the book of
words employed by the special class of Ug&#257;t&#7771;i priests at the
soma sacrifice. Its stanzas assume their proper character of musical
<i>S&#257;mans</i> or chants only in the various song-books called
<i>g&#257;nas</i>, which indicate the prolongation, the repetition, and
the interpolation of syllables necessary in singing, just as is often
done in European publications when the words are given below the
musical notation. There are four of these songbooks <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>in
existence, two belonging to each division of the Veda. The number of
<i>S&#257;mans</i> here given of course admitted of being indefinitely
increased, as each verse could be sung to many melodies.</p>
<p>The <i>S&#257;maveda</i> consists of 1549 stanzas, distributed in
two books called <i>&#257;rchikas</i> or collections of
<i>&#7771;ich</i> verses. The principle of arrangement in these two
books is different. The first is divided into six lessons
(<i>prap&#257;&#7789;haka</i>), each of which contains ten decades
(<i>da&ccedil;at</i>) of stanzas, except the sixth, which has only
nine. The verses of the first twelve decades are addressed to Agni,
those of the last eleven to Soma, while those of the intermediate
thirty-six are chiefly invocations of Indra, the great soma-drinker.
The second book contains nine lessons, each of which is divided into
two, and sometimes three sections. It consists throughout of small
groups of stanzas, which, generally three in number, are closely
connected, the first in the group being usually found in the first book
also. That the second book is both later in date and secondary in
character is indicated by its repeating stanzas from the first book as
well as by its deviating much less from the text of the <i>Rigveda</i>.
It is also a significant fact in this connection that the verses of the
first book which recur in the second agree more closely with the
readings of the <i>Rigveda</i> than the other verses by which they are
surrounded. This can only be accounted for by the supposition that they
were consciously altered in order to accord with the same verses in the
second book which were directly influenced by the <i>Rigveda</i>, while
the readings of the first book had diverged more widely because that
book had been handed down, since the original borrowing, by an
independent tradition.</p>
<p>We know from statements of the <i>&Ccedil;atapatha
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href=
"#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>that the divisions of the first
book of the <i>S&#257;maveda</i> existed at least as early as the
period when the second part of that Br&#257;hmana was composed. There
is, moreover, some reason to believe that the <i>S&#257;maveda</i> as a
collection is older than at least the <i>Taittir&#299;ya</i> and the
<i>V&#257;jasaneyi</i> recensions of the <i>Yajurveda</i>. For the
latter contain verses, used also as <i>S&#257;man</i> chants, in a form
which shows the variations of the <i>S&#257;maveda</i> in contrast with
the <i>Rigveda</i>. This is all the more striking as the
<i>V&#257;jasaneyi</i> text has an undoubted tendency to adhere to the
readings of the <i>Rigveda</i>. On the other hand, the view expressed
by Professor Weber that numerous variants in verses of the
<i>S&#257;maveda</i> contain archaic forms as compared with the
<i>Rigveda</i>, and were therefore borrowed at a time before the
existing redaction of the <i>Rigveda</i> took place, has been shown to
be untenable. The various readings of the <i>S&#257;maveda</i> are
really due in part to inferior tradition, and in part to arbitrary
alterations made in order to adapt verses detached from their context
to the ritual purpose to which they were applied.</p>
<p>Two schools of the <i>S&#257;maveda</i> are known&mdash;the
Kauthumas and the R&#257;&#7751;&#257;yan&#299;yas, the former of whom
are said still to exist in Gujarat, while the latter, at one time
settled mainly in the Mahratta country, are said to survive in Eastern
Hyderabad. Their recensions of the text appear to have differed but
little from each other. That of the R&#257;&#7751;&#257;yan&#257;yas
has been published more than once. The earliest edition, brought out by
a missionary named Stevenson in 1842, was entirely superseded by the
valuable work of Benfey, which, containing a German translation and
glossary besides the text, came out in 1848. The <i>S&#257;maveda</i>
was thus the first of the Vedas to be edited in its entirety. The text
of this Veda, according to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href=
"#pb174" name="pb174">174</a>]</span>the recension of the same school,
together with the commentary of S&#257;ya&#7751;a, was subsequently
edited in India. Of the Kauthuma recension nothing has been preserved
excepting the seventh <i>prap&#257;&#7789;haka</i>, which, in the
Naigeya subdivision of this school, forms an addition to the first
<i>&#257;rchika</i>, and was edited in 1868. Two indices of the deities
and composers of the <i>S&#257;maveda</i> according to the Naigeya
school have also been preserved, and indirectly supply information
about the text of the Kauthuma recension.</p>
<p>The <i>Yajurveda</i> introduces us not only to a geographical area
different from that of the <i>Rigveda</i>, but also to a new epoch of
religious and social life in India. The centre of Vedic civilisation is
now found to lie farther to the east. We hear no more of the Indus and
its tributaries; for the geographical data of all the recensions of the
<i>Yajurveda</i> point to the territory in the middle of Northern India
occupied by the neighbouring peoples of the Kurus and Panch&#257;las.
The country of the former, called Kurukshetra, is specifically the holy
land of the <i>Yajurvedas</i> and of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as attached
to them. It lay in the plain between the Sutlej and the Jumna,
beginning with the tract bounded by the two small rivers
D&#7771;ishadvat&#299; and Sarasvat&#299;, and extending
south-eastwards to the Jumna. It corresponds to the modern district of
Sirhind. Closely connected with, and eastward of this region, was
situated the land of the Panch&#257;las, which, running south-east from
the Meerut district to Allahabad, embraces the territory between the
Jumna and the Ganges called the Doab (&ldquo;Two Waters&rdquo;).
Kurukshetra was the country in which the Brahmanic religious and social
system was developed, and from which it spread over the rest of India.
It claims a further historical <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175"
href="#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span>interest as being in later
times the scene of the conflict, described in the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>, between the Panch&#257;las and Matsyas on
the one hand, and the Kurus, including the ancient Bharatas, on the
other. In the famous lawbook of Manu the land of the Kurus is still
regarded with veneration as the special home of Brahmanism, and as such
is designated Brahm&#257;varta. Together with the country of the
Panch&#257;las, and that of their neighbours to the south of the Jumna,
the Matsyas (with Mathur&#257;, now Muttra, as their capital) and the
&Ccedil;&#363;rasenas, it is spoken of as the land of Brahman sages,
where the bravest warriors and the most pious priests live, and the
customs and usages of which are authoritative.</p>
<p>Here the adherents of the <i>Yajurveda</i> split up into several
schools, which gradually spread over other parts of India, the
Ka&#7789;has, with their subdivision the Kapish&#7789;halas, being in
the time of the Greeks located in the Panj&#257;b, and later in Kashmir
also. The Ka&#7789;has are now to be found in Kashmir only, while the
Kapish&#7789;halas have entirely disappeared. The
Maitr&#257;ya&#7751;&#299;yas, originally called K&#257;l&#257;pas,
appear at one time to have occupied the region around the lower course
of the Narmad&#257; for a distance of some two hundred miles from the
sea, extending to the south of its mouth more than a hundred miles, as
far as N&#257;asik, and northwards beyond the modern city of Baroda.
There are now only a few remnants of this school to the north of the
Narmad&#257; in Gujarat, chiefly at Ahmedabad, and farther west at
Morvi. Before the beginning of our era these two ancient schools must
have been very widely diffused in India. For the grammarian Patanjali
speaks of the Ka&#7789;has and K&#257;l&#257;pas as the universally
known schools of the <i>Yajurveda</i>, whose doctrines were proclaimed
in every village. From the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i>, moreover,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span>we learn that these two schools were highly
honoured in Ayodhy&#257; (Oudh) also. They were, however, gradually
ousted by the two younger schools of the <i>Yajurveda</i>. Of these,
the Taittir&#299;yas have been found only to the south of the
Narmad&#257;, where they can be traced as far back as the fourth
century A.D. Their most important subdivision, that of the
&#256;pastambas, still survives in the territory of the
God&#257;var&#299;, while another, the Hira&#7751;yake&ccedil;ins, are
found still farther south. The school of the V&#257;jasaneyins spread
towards the south-east, down the Ganges Valley. At the present day they
occupy a wide area, embracing North-East and Central India.</p>
<p>Each of these four schools has preserved one or two recensions of
the <i>Yajurveda</i>. The text of the <i>Maitr&#257;ya&#7751;&#299;
Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i>, which consists of four books
(<i>k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</i>), subdivided into fifty-four lessons
(<i>prap&#257;&#7789;haka</i>), has been edited by Professor L. v.
Schroeder (1881&ndash;86). The same scholar is preparing an edition of
the <i>K&#257;&#7789;haka Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i>, the recension of the
Ka&#7789;ha school. These two recensions are nearly related in
language, having many forms in common which are not found elsewhere. Of
the <i>Kapish&#7789;hala-Ka&#7789;ha Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i> only
somewhat corrupt fragments have hitherto come to light, and it is very
doubtful whether sufficient manuscript material will ever be discovered
to render an edition of this text possible. The <i>Taittir&#299;ya
Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i>, which comprises seven books, and is subdivided
into forty-four lessons, is somewhat later in origin than the
above-mentioned recensions. It was edited by Professor A. Weber in
1871&ndash;72. These texts of the <i>Yajurveda</i> form a closely
connected group, for they are essentially the same in character. Their
agreement is often even verbal, especially in the verses and formulas
for recitation which they contain. They <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb177" href="#pb177" name="pb177">177</a>]</span>also agree in
arranging their matter according to a similar principle, which is
different from that of the <i>V&#257;jasaneyi</i> recension.</p>
<p>The <i>Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i> of the latter consists entirely of the
verses and formulas to be recited at the sacrifice, and is therefore
clear (<i>&ccedil;ukla</i>), that is to say, separated from the
explanatory matter which is collected in the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a. Hence
it is called the <i>White</i> (<i>&ccedil;ukla</i>) <i>Yajurveda</i>,
while the others, under the general name of <i>Black</i>
(<i>k&#7771;ish&#7751;a</i>) <i>Yajurveda</i>, are contrasted with it,
as containing both kinds of matter mixed up in the
<i>Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i>. The text of the V&#257;jasaneyins has been
preserved in two recensions, that of the M&#257;dhyam&#803;dinas and of
the K&#257;&#7751;vas. These are almost identical in their
subject-matter as well as its arrangement. Their divergences hardly go
beyond varieties of reading, which, moreover, appear only in their
prose formulas, not in their verses. Agreeing thus closely, they cannot
be separated in their origin by any wide interval of time. Their
discrepancies probably arose rather from geographical separation, since
each has its own peculiarities of spelling. The <i>White Yajurveda</i>
in both these recensions has been edited by Professor Weber
(1849&ndash;52).</p>
<p>It is divided into forty chapters, called <i>adhy&#257;yas</i>. That
it originally consisted of the first eighteen alone is indicated by
external as well as internal evidence. This is the only portion
containing verses and prose formulas (both having the common name of
<i>mantras</i>) which recur in the <i>Taittir&#299;ya
Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i>, the sole exceptions being a few passages
relating to the horse-sacrifice in chapters 22&ndash;25. Otherwise the
contents of the last twenty-two chapters are found again only in the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a and the &#256;ra&#7751;yaka belonging to the
<i>Taittir&#299;ya Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i>. Moreover, it is only the
<i>mantras</i> of the first <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href=
"#pb178" name="pb178">178</a>]</span>eighteen chapters of the
<i>V&#257;jasaneyi Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i> which are quoted and
explained word by word in the first nine books of its own
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a, while merely a few <i>mantras</i> from the
following seventeen chapters are mentioned in that work. According to
the further testimony of an ancient index of the <i>White
Yajurveda</i>, attributed to K&#257;ty&#257;yana, the ten chapters
26&ndash;35 form a supplement (<i>khila</i>).</p>
<p>The internal evidence of the <i>V&#257;jasaneyi
Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i> leads to similar conclusions. The fact that
chapters 26&ndash;29 contain <i>mantras</i> relating to ceremonies
dealt with in previous chapters and requiring to be applied to those
ceremonies, is a clear indication of their supplementary character. The
next ten chapters (30&ndash;39) are concerned with altogether new
ceremonies, such as the human sacrifice, the universal sacrifice, and
the sacrifice to the Manes. Lastly, the 40th chapter must be a late
addition, for it stands in no direct relation to the ritual and bears
the character of an Upanishad. Different parts of the
<i>Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i>, moreover, furnish some data pointing to
different periods of religious and social development. In the 16th
chapter the god Rudra is described by a large number of epithets which
are subsequently peculiar to &Ccedil;iva. Two, however, which are
particularly significant, <i>&#298;&ccedil;&#257;na</i>,
&ldquo;Ruler,&rdquo; and <i>Mah&#257;deva</i>, &ldquo;Great God,&rdquo;
are absent here, but are added in the 39th chapter. These, as
indicating a special worship of the god, represent a later development.
Again, the 30th chapter specifies most of the Indian mixed castes,
while the 16th mentions only a few of them. Hence, it is likely that at
least some which are known to the former chapter did not as yet exist
when the latter was composed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179"
href="#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span></p>
<p>On these grounds four chronological strata may be distinguished in
the <i>White Yajurveda</i>. To the fundamental portion, comprising
chapters 1&ndash;18, the next seven must first have been added, for
these two parts deal with the general sacrificial ceremonial. The
development of the ritual led to the compilation of the next fourteen
chapters, which are concerned with ceremonies already treated
(26&ndash;29) or entirely new (30&ndash;39). The last chapter
apparently dates from a period when the excessive growth of ritual
practices led to a reaction. It does not supply sacrificial
<i>mantras</i>, but aims at establishing a mean between exclusive
devotion to and total neglect of the sacrificial ceremonies.</p>
<p>Even the original portion of the <i>White Yajurveda</i> must have
assumed shape somewhat later than any of the recensions of the
<i>Black</i>. For the systematic and orderly distribution of matter by
which the <i>mantras</i> are collected in the
<i>Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i>, while their dogmatic explanation is entirely
relegated to a Br&#257;hma&#7751;a, can hardly be as old as the
confused arrangement in which both parts are largely mixed up.</p>
<p>The two most important portions of the <i>Yajurvedas</i> deal with
the new and full moon sacrifices, as well as the soma sacrifice, on the
one hand, and with the construction of the fire-altar on the other.
Chapters 1&ndash;10 of the <i>White Yajurveda</i> contain the
<i>mantras</i> for the former, chapters 11&ndash;18 those for the
latter part of the ceremonial. The corresponding ritual explanations
are to be found in books 1&ndash;5 and 6&ndash;9 respectively of the
<i>&Ccedil;atapatha Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>. In these fundamental
portions even the <i>Black Yajurveda</i> does not intermingle the
<i>mantras</i> with their explanations. The first book of the
<i>Taittir&#299;ya Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i> contains in its first four
lessons <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>nothing but the verses and formulas to be
recited at the fortnightly and the soma sacrifices; the fourth book,
nothing but those employed in the fire-altar ritual. These books follow
the same order as, and in fact furnish a parallel recension of, the
corresponding parts of the <i>V&#257;jasaneyi Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i>.
On the other hand, the <i>Taittir&#299;ya Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i>
contains within itself, but in a different part, the two corresponding
Br&#257;hma&#7751;as, which, on the whole, are free from admixture with
<i>mantras</i>. The fifth book is the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a of the fire
ritual, and the sixth is that of the soma sacrifice; but the dogmatic
explanation of the new and full moon sacrifice is altogether omitted
here, being found in the third book of the <i>Taittir&#299;ya
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>. In the <i>Maitr&#257;ya&#7751;&#299;
Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i> the distribution of the corresponding material
is similar. The first three lessons of the first book contain the
<i>mantras</i> only for the fortnightly and the soma sacrifices; the
latter half of the second book (lessons 7&ndash;13), the <i>mantras</i>
only for the fire ritual. The corresponding Br&#257;hma&#7751;as begin
with the sixth and the first lesson respectively of the third book. It
is only in the additions to these fundamental parts of the <i>Black
Yajurveda</i> that the separation of Mantra and Br&#257;hma&#7751;a is
not carried out. The main difference, then, between the <i>Black</i>
and the <i>White</i> consists in the former combining within the same
collection Br&#257;hma&#7751;a as well as Mantra matter. As to its
chief and fundamental parts, there is no reason to suppose that these
two kinds of matter, which are kept separate and unmixed, are either
chronologically or essentially more nearly related than are the
<i>V&#257;jasaneyi Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i> and the <i>&Ccedil;atapatha
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Yajurveda</i> resembles the <i>S&#257;maveda</i> in having
been compiled for application to sacrificial rites only. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span>But
while the <i>S&#257;maveda</i> deals solely with one part of the
ritual, the soma sacrifice, the <i>Yajurveda</i> supplies the formulas
for the whole sacrificial ceremonial. Like the <i>S&#257;maveda</i>, it
is also connected with the <i>Rigveda</i>; but while the former is
practically altogether extracted from the <i>Rigveda</i>, the
<i>Yajurveda</i>, though borrowing many of its verses from the same
source, is largely an original production. Thus somewhat more than
one-fourth only of the <i>V&#257;jasaneyi Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i> is
derived from the <i>Rigveda</i>, One half of this collection consists
of verses (<i>&#7771;ich</i>) most of which (upwards of 700) are found
in the <i>Rigveda</i>; the other half is made up of prose formulas
(<i>yajus</i>). The latter, as well as the verses not borrowed from the
<i>Rigveda</i>, are the independent creation of the composers of the
<i>Yajurveda</i>. This partial originality was indeed a necessary
result of the growth of entirely new ceremonies and the extraordinary
development of ritual detail. It became impossible to obtain from the
<i>Rigveda</i> even approximately suitable verses for these novel
requirements.</p>
<p>The language of the Mantra portion of the <i>Yajurveda</i>, though
distinctly representing a later stage, yet on the whole agrees with
that of the <i>Rigveda</i>, while separated from that of classical
Sanskrit by a considerable interval.</p>
<p>On its mythological side the religion of the <i>Yajurveda</i> does
not differ essentially from that of the older Veda; for the pantheon is
still the same. Some important modifications in detail are, however,
apparent. The figure of Praj&#257;pati, only foreshadowed in the latest
hymns of the <i>Rigveda</i>, comes more and more into the foreground as
the chief of the gods. The Rudra of the <i>Rigveda</i> has begun to
appear on the scene as &Ccedil;iva, being <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb182" href="#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>several times
mentioned by that name as well as by other epithets later peculiar to
&Ccedil;iva, such as &Ccedil;ankara and Mah&#257;deva. Vish&#7751;u now
occupies a somewhat more prominent position than in the <i>Rigveda</i>.
A new feature is his constant identification with the sacrifice. The
demons, now regularly called Asuras, perpetually appear as a group of
evil beings opposed to the good gods. Their conflicts with the latter
play a considerable part in the myths of the <i>Yajurveda</i>. The
Apsarases, who, as a class of celestial nymphs endowed with all the
seductive charms of female beauty, occupy so important a place in
post-Vedic mythology, but are very rarely mentioned in the
<i>Rigveda</i>, begin to be more prominent in the <i>Yajurveda</i>, in
which many of them are referred to by individual names.</p>
<p>Certain religious conceptions have, moreover, been modified and new
rites introduced. Thus the word <i>brahma</i>, which in the
<i>Rigveda</i> meant simply &ldquo;devotion,&rdquo; has come to signify
the essence of prayer and holiness, an advance towards its ultimate
sense in the Upanishads. Again, snake-worship, which is unknown to the
<i>Rigveda</i>, now appears as an element in Indian religion. That,
however, which impresses on the <i>Yajurveda</i> the stamp of a new
epoch is the character of the worship which it represents. The relative
importance of the gods and of the sacrifice in the older religion has
now become inverted. In the <i>Rigveda</i> the object of devotion was
the gods, for the power of bestowing benefits on mankind was believed
to lie in their hands alone, while the sacrifice was only a means of
influencing their will in favour of the offerer. In the
<i>Yajurveda</i> the sacrifice itself has become the centre of thought
and desire, its correct performance in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb183" href="#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>every detail being
all-important. Its power is now so great that it not merely influences,
but compels the gods to do the will of the officiating priest. By means
of it the Brahmans may, in fact, be said to hold the gods in their
hands.</p>
<p>The religion of the <i>Yajurveda</i> may be described as a kind of
mechanical sacerdotalism. A crowd of priests conducts a vast and
complicated system of external ceremonies, to which symbolical
significance is attributed, and to the smallest minuti&aelig; of which
the greatest weight is attached. In this stifling atmosphere of
perpetual sacrifice and ritual, the truly religious spirit of the
<i>Rigveda</i> could not possibly survive. Adoration of the power and
beneficence of the gods, as well as the consciousness of guilt, is
entirely lacking, every prayer being coupled with some particular rite
and aiming solely at securing material advantages. As a natural result,
the formulas of the <i>Yajurveda</i> are full of dreary repetitions or
variations of the same idea, and abound with half or wholly
unintelligible interjections, particularly the syllable <i>om</i>. The
following quotation from the <i>Maitr&#257;ya&#7751;&#299;
Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i> is a good example: <i>Nidh&#257;yo v&#257;
nidh&#257;yo v&#257; om&#803; v&#257; om&#803; v&#257; om&#803; v&#257;
&#275; ai om&#803; svar&#7751;ajyotih&#803;</i>. Here only the last
word, which means &ldquo;golden light,&rdquo; is translatable.</p>
<p>Thus the ritual could not fail to become more and more of a mystery
to all who did not belong to the Brahman caste. To its formulas, no
less than to the sacrifice itself, control over Nature as well as the
supernatural powers is attributed. Thus there are certain formulas for
the obtainment of victory; by means of these, it is said, Indra
constantly vanquished the demons. Again, we learn that, if the priest
pronounces <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span>a formula for rain while mixing a certain
offering, he causes the rain to stream down. Hence the formulas are
regarded as having a kind of magical effect by exercising compulsion.
Similar miraculous powers later came to be attached to penance and
asceticism among the Brahmans, and to holiness among the Buddhists. The
formulas of the <i>Yajurveda</i> have not, as a rule, the form of
prayers addressed to the gods, but on the whole and characteristically
consist of statements about the result of employing particular rites
and <i>mantras</i>. Together with the corresponding ritual they furnish
a complex mass of appliances ready to hand for the obtainment of
material welfare in general as well as all sorts of special objects,
such as cattle or a village. The presence of a priest capable of using
the necessary forms correctly is of course always presupposed. The
desires which several rites are meant to fulfil amount to nothing more
than childish absurdity. Thus some of them aim at the obtainment of the
year. Formulas to secure possession of the moon would have had equal
practical value.</p>
<p>Hand in hand with the elaboration of the sacrificial ceremonial went
the growth and consolidation of the caste system, in which the Brahmans
secured the social as well as the religious supremacy, and which has
held India enchained for more than two thousand five hundred years. Not
only do we find the four castes firmly established as the main
divisions of Indian society in the <i>Yajurveda</i>, but, as one of the
later books of the <i>V&#257;jasaneyi Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i> shows,
most of the mixed castes known in later times are already found to
exist. The social as well as the religious conditions of the Indian
people, therefore, now wear an aspect essentially differing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=
"pb185">185</a>]</span>from those revealed to us in the hymns of the
<i>Rigveda</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Rig</i>-, <i>S&#257;ma</i>-, and <i>Yajur-vedas</i> alone
were originally recognised as canonical collections. For they only were
concerned with the great sacrificial ceremonial. The
<i>Atharva-veda</i>, with the exception of the last book, which was
obviously added in order to connect it with that ceremonial, is
essentially unconnected with it. The ceremonial to which its hymns were
practically applied is, with few exceptions, that with which the
G&#7771;ihya S&#363;tras deal, being domestic rites such as those of
birth, marriage, and death, or the political rites relating to the
inauguration of kings. Taken as a whole, it is a heterogeneous
collection of spells. Its most salient teaching is sorcery, for it is
mainly directed against hostile agencies, such as diseases, noxious
animals, demons, wizards, foes, oppressors of Brahmans. But it also
contains many spells of an auspicious character, such as charms to
secure harmony in family and village life, reconciliation of enemies,
long life, health, and prosperity, besides prayers for protection on
journeys, and for luck in gambling. Thus it has a double aspect, being
meant to appease and bless as well as to curse.</p>
<p>In its main contents the <i>Atharva-veda</i> is more superstitious
than the <i>Rigveda</i>. For it does not represent the more advanced
religious beliefs of the priestly class, but is a collection of the
most popular spells current among the masses, who always preserve more
primitive notions with regard to demoniac powers. The spirit which
breathes in it is that of a prehistoric age. A few of its actual charms
probably date with little modification from the Indo-European period;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=
"pb186">186</a>]</span>for, as Adalbert Kuhn has shown, some of its
spells for curing bodily ailments agree in purpose and content, as well
as to some extent even in form, with certain old German, Lettic, and
Russian charms. But with regard to the higher religious ideas relating
to the gods, it represents a more recent and advanced stage than the
<i>Rigveda</i>. It contains, indeed, more theosophic matter than any of
the other Sam&#803;hit&#257;s. For the history of civilisation it is on
the whole more interesting and important than the <i>Rigveda</i>
itself.</p>
<p>The <i>Atharva-veda</i> is extant in the recensions of two different
schools. That of the Paippal&#257;das is, however, known in a single
birch-bark manuscript, which is ancient but inaccurate and mostly
unaccented. It was discovered by Professor B&uuml;hler in Kashmir, and
has been described by Professor Roth in his tract <i>Der Atharvaveda in
Kaschmir</i> (1875). It will probably soon be accessible to scholars in
the form of a photographic reproduction published by Professor
Bloomfield. This recension is doubtless meant by the
&ldquo;Paippal&#257;da Mantras&rdquo; mentioned in one of the
<i>Pari&ccedil;ish&#7789;as</i> or supplementary writings of the
<i>Atharva-veda</i>.</p>
<p>The printed text, edited by Roth and Whitney in 1856, gives the
recension of the &Ccedil;aunaka school. Nearly the whole of
S&#257;ya&#7751;a&rsquo;s commentary to the <i>Atharva-veda</i> has
been edited in India. Its chief interest lies in the large number of
readings supplied by it which differ from those of the printed edition
of this Veda.</p>
<p>This Sam&#803;hit&#257; is divided into twenty books, containing 730
hymns and about 6000 stanzas. Some 1200 of the latter are derived from
the <i>Rigveda</i>, chiefly from the tenth, first, and eighth books, a
few also from each of the other books. Of the 143 hymns of Book XX.,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=
"pb187">187</a>]</span>all but twelve are taken bodily from the
established text of the <i>Rigveda</i> without any change. The matter
borrowed from the <i>Rigveda</i> in the other books shows considerable
varieties of reading, but these, as in the other Sam&#803;hit&#257;s,
are of inferior value compared with the text of the <i>Rigveda</i>. As
is the case in the <i>Yajurveda</i>, a considerable part of the
<i>Atharva</i> (about one-sixth) consists of prose. Upwards of fifty
hymns, comprising the whole of the fifteenth and sixteenth, besides
some thirty hymns scattered in the other books, are entirely
unmetrical. Parts or single stanzas of over a hundred other hymns are
of a similar character.</p>
<p>That the <i>Atharva-veda</i> originally consisted of its first
thirteen books only is shown both by its arrangement and by its
subject-matter. The contents of Books I.&ndash;VII. are distributed
according to the number of stanzas contained in the hymns. In Book I.
they have on the average four stanzas, in II. five, in III. six, in IV.
seven, in V. eight to eighteen, in VI. three; and in VII. about half
the hymns have only one stanza each. Books VIII.&ndash;XIII. contain
longer pieces. The contents of all these thirteen books are
indiscriminately intermingled.</p>
<p>The following five books, on the contrary, are arranged according to
uniformity of subject-matter. Book XIV. contains the stanzas relating
to the wedding rite, which consist largely of <i>mantras</i> from the
tenth book of the <i>Rigveda</i>. Book XV. is a glorification of the
Supreme Being under the name of Vr&#257;tya, while XVI. and XVII.
contain certain conjurations. The whole of XV. and nearly the whole of
XVI., moreover, are composed in prose of the type found in the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;as. Both XVI. and XVII. are very short, the former
containing nine hymns occupying four printed pages, the latter
consisting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span>of only a single hymn, which extends to little
more than two pages. Book XVIII. deals with burial and the Manes. Like
XIV., it derives most of its stanzas from the tenth book of the
<i>Rigveda</i>. Both these books are, therefore, not specifically
Atharvan in character.</p>
<p>The last two books are manifestly late additions. Book XIX. consists
of a mixture of supplementary pieces, part of the text of which is
rather corrupt. Book XX., with a slight exception, contains only
complete hymns addressed to Indra, which are borrowed directly and
without any variation from the <i>Rigveda</i>. The fact that its
readings are identical with those of the <i>Rigveda</i> would alone
suffice to show that it is of later date than the original books, the
readings of which show considerable divergences from those of the older
Veda. There is, however, more convincing proof of the lateness of this
book. Its matter relates to the Soma ritual, and is entirely foreign to
the spirit of the <i>Atharva-veda</i>. It was undoubtedly added to
establish the claim of the <i>Atharva</i> to the position of a fourth
Veda, by bringing it into connection with the recognised sacrificial
ceremonial of the three old Vedas. This book, again, as well as the
nineteenth, is not noticed in the <i>Pr&#257;ti&ccedil;&#257;khya</i>
of the <i>Atharva-veda</i>. Both of them must, therefore, have been
added after that work was composed. Excepting two prose pieces (48 and
49) the only original part of Book XX. is the so-called
<i>kunt&#257;pa</i> hymns (127&ndash;136). These are allied to the
<i>d&#257;nastutis</i> of the <i>Rigveda</i>, those panegyrics of
liberal kings or sacrificers which were the forerunners of epic
narratives in praise of warlike princes and heroes.</p>
<p>The existence of the <i>Atharva</i>, as a collection of some kind,
when the last books of the <i>&Ccedil;atapatha Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>(xi., xiii., xiv.), the <i>Taittir&#299;ya
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>, and the <i>Chh&#257;ndogya Upanishad</i> were
composed, is proved by the references to it in those works. In
Patanjali&rsquo;s <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;shya</i> the <i>Atharva</i> had
already attained to such an assured position that it is even cited at
the head of the Vedas, and occasionally as their only
representative.</p>
<p>The oldest name of this Veda is <i>Atharv&#257;ngirasah&#803;</i>, a
designation occurring in the text of the <i>Atharva-veda</i>, and found
at the beginning of its MSS. themselves. This word is a compound formed
of the names of two ancient families of priests, the Atharvans and
Angirases. In the opinion of Professor Bloomfield the former term is
here synonymous with &ldquo;holy charms,&rdquo; as referring to
auspicious practices, while the latter is an equivalent of
&ldquo;witchcraft charms.&rdquo; The term <i>atharvan</i> and its
derivatives, though representing only its benevolent side, would thus
have come to designate the fourth Veda as a whole. In its plural form
(<i>atharv&#257;&#7751;ah&#803;</i>) the word in this sense is found
several times in the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as, but in the singular it seems
first to occur in an Upanishad. The adjective
<i>&#257;tharva&#7751;a</i>, first found as a neuter plural with the
sense of &ldquo;Atharvan hymns&rdquo; in the <i>Atharva-veda</i> itself
(Book XIX.), is common from that time onwards. The name
<i>atharva-veda</i> first appears in S&#363;tras about as early as
<i>&#7771;igveda</i> and similar designations of the other
Sam&#803;hit&#257;s. There are besides two other names of the
<i>Atharva-veda</i>, the use of which is practically limited to the
ritual texts of this Veda. In one of these,
<i>Bh&#7771;igu-angirasah&#803;</i>, the name of another ancient family
of fire-priests, the Bh&#7771;igus, takes the place of that of the
Angirases. The other, <i>brahma-veda</i>, has outside the Atharvan
literature only been found once, and that in a G&#7771;ihya S&#363;tra
of the <i>Rigveda</i>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href=
"#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span></p>
<p>A considerable time elapsed before the <i>Atharva-veda</i>, owing to
the general character of its contents, attained to the rank of a
canonical book. There is no evidence that even at the latest period of
the <i>Rigveda</i> the charms constituting the <i>Atharva-veda</i> were
formally recognised as a separate literary category. For the Purusha
hymn, while mentioning the three sacrificial Vedas by the names of
<i>Rik</i>, <i>S&#257;man</i>, and <i>Yajus</i>, makes no reference to
the spells of the <i>Atharva-veda</i>. Yet the <i>Rigveda</i>, though
it is mainly concerned with praises of the gods in connection with the
sacrifice, contains hymns showing that sorcery was bound up with
domestic practices from the earliest times in India. The only reference
to the spells of the <i>Atharva-veda</i> as a class in the
<i>Yajurvedas</i> is found in the <i>Taittir&#299;ya
Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i>, where they are alluded to under the name of
<i>angirasah&#803;</i> by the side of <i>Rik</i>, <i>S&#257;man</i>,
and <i>Yajus</i>, which it elsewhere mentions alone. Yet the formulas
of the <i>Yajur-veda</i> are often pervaded by the spirit of the
<i>Atharva-veda</i>, and are sometimes Atharvan even in their wording.
In fact, the difference between the <i>Rigveda</i> and <i>Yajurveda</i>
on the one hand, and the <i>Atharva</i> on the other, as regards
sorcery, lies solely in the degree of its applicability and
prominence.</p>
<p>The <i>Atharva-veda</i> itself only once mentions its own literary
type directly (as <i>atharv&#257;ngirasah&#803;</i>) and once
indirectly (as <i>bheshaj&#257;</i> or &ldquo;auspicious
spells&rdquo;), by the side of the other three Vedas, while the latter
in a considerable number of passages are referred to alone. This shows
that as yet there was no feeling of antagonism between the adherents of
this Veda and those of the older ones.</p>
<p>Turning to the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as, we find that those of the
<i>Rigveda</i> do not mention the <i>Atharva-veda</i> at all, while
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=
"pb191">191</a>]</span>the <i>Taittir&#299;ya Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>
(like the <i>Taittir&#299;ya &#256;ra&#7751;yaka</i>) refers to it
twice. In the <i>&Ccedil;atapatha Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i> it appears
more frequently, occupying a more defined position, though not that of
a Veda. This work very often mentions the three old Vedas alone, either
explicitly as <i>Rik</i>, <i>S&#257;man</i>, <i>Yajus</i>, or as
<i>tray&#299; vidy&#257;</i>, &ldquo;the threefold knowledge.&rdquo; In
several passages they are also mentioned along with other literary
types, such as <i>itih&#257;sa</i> (story), <i>pur&#257;&#7751;a</i>
(ancient legend)<span class="corr" id="xd21e5635" title=
"Not in source">,</span> <i>g&#257;th&#257;</i> (song),
<i>s&#363;tra</i>, and <i>upanishad</i>. In these enumerations the
<i>Atharva-veda</i> regularly occupies the fourth place, coming
immediately after the three Vedas, while the rest follow in varying
order. The Upanishads in general treat the <i>Atharva-veda</i> in the
same way; the Upanishads of the <i>Atharva</i> itself, however,
sometimes tacitly add its name after the three Vedas, even without
mentioning other literary types. With regard to the &Ccedil;rauta or
sacrificial S&#363;tras, we find no reference to the <i>Atharva</i> in
those of K&#257;ty&#257;yana (<i>White Yajurveda</i>) or
L&#257;&#7789;y&#257;yana (<i>S&#257;maveda</i>), and only one each in
those of &Ccedil;&#257;nkh&#257;yana and &#256;&ccedil;val&#257;yana
(<i>Rigveda</i>).</p>
<p>In all this sacrificial literature there is no evidence of
repugnance to the <i>Atharva</i>, or of exclusiveness towards it on the
part of followers of the other Vedas. Such an attitude could indeed
hardly be expected. For though the sphere of the Vedic sacrificial
ritual was different from that of regular magical rites, it is
impossible to draw a distinct line of demarcation between sacrifice and
sorcery in the Vedic religion, of which witchcraft is, in fact, an
essential element. The adherents of the three sacrificial Vedas would
thus naturally recognise a work which was a repository of witchcraft.
Thus the <i>&Ccedil;atapatha Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>, though
characterising <i>y&#257;tu</i> or sorcery as devilish&mdash;doubtless
because it may be dangerous to those <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb192" href="#pb192" name="pb192">192</a>]</span>who practise
it&mdash;places <i>y&#257;tuvidah&#803;</i> or sorcerers by the side of
<i>bahv&#7771;ichas</i> or men skilled in Rigvedic verses. Just as the
<i>Rigveda</i> contains very few hymns directly connected with the
practice of sorcery, so the <i>Atharva</i> originally included only
matters incidental and subsidiary to the sacrificial ritual. Thus it
contains a series of formulas (vi. 47&ndash;48) which have no meaning
except in connection with the three daily pressings (<i>savana</i>) of
soma. We also find in it hymns (<i>e. g.</i> vi. 114) which evidently
consist of formulas of expiation for faults committed at the sacrifice.
We must therefore conclude that the followers of the <i>Atharva</i> to
some extent knew and practised the sacrificial ceremonial before the
conclusion of the present redaction of their hymns. The relation of the
<i>Atharva</i> to the <i>&ccedil;rauta</i> rites was, however,
originally so slight, that it became necessary, in order to establish a
direct connection with it, to add the twentieth book, which was
compiled from the <i>Rigveda</i> for the purposes of the sacrificial
ceremonial.</p>
<p>The conspicuous way in which <i>&ccedil;rauta</i> works ignore the
<i>Atharva</i> is therefore due to its being almost entirely
unconnected with the subject-matter of the sacrifice, not to any
pronounced disapproval or refusal to recognise its value in its own
sphere. With the G&#7771;ihya or Domestic S&#363;tras, which contain
many elements of sorcery practice (<i>vidh&#257;na</i>), we should
expect the <i>Atharva</i> to betray a closer connection. This is,
indeed, to some extent the case; for many verses quoted in these
S&#363;tras are identical with or variants of those contained in the
<i>Atharva</i>, even though the Domestic, like the Sacrificial,
S&#363;tras endeavoured to borrow their verses as far as possible from
the particular Veda to which they were attached. Otherwise, however,
their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>references to the <i>Atharva</i> betray no
greater regard for it than those in the Sacrificial S&#363;tras do.
Such references to the fourth Veda are here, it is true, more frequent
and formulaic; but this appears to mean nothing more than that the
G&#7771;ihya S&#363;tras belong to a later date.</p>
<p>In the sphere, too, of law (<i>dharma</i>), as dealing with popular
usage and custom, the practices of the <i>Atharva</i> maintained a
certain place; for the indispensable sciences of medicine and astrology
were distinctively Atharvan, and the king&rsquo;s domestic chaplain
(<i>purohita</i>), believed capable of rendering great services in the
injury and overthrow of enemies by sorcery, seems usually to have been
an Atharvan priest. At the same time it is only natural that we should
first meet with censures of the practices of the <i>Atharva</i> in the
legal literature, because such practices were thought to enable one man
to harm another. The verdict of the law treatises on the whole is, that
as incantations of various kinds are injurious, the <i>Atharva-veda</i>
is inferior and its practices impure. This inferiority is directly
expressed in the Dharma S&#363;tra of &#256;pastamba; and the later
legal treatise (<i>sm&#7771;iti</i>) of Vish&#7751;u classes the
reciter of a deadly incantation from the <i>Atharva</i> among the seven
kinds of assassins. Physicians and astrologers are pronounced impure;
practices with roots are prohibited; sorceries and imprecations are
punished with severe penances. In certain cases, however, the
<i>Atharva-veda</i> is stated to be useful. Thus the Lawbook of Manu
recommends it as the natural weapon of the Brahman against his
enemies.</p>
<p>In the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> we find the importance and the
canonical character of the <i>Atharva</i> fully recognised.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>The four Vedas are often mentioned, the gods
Brahm&#257; and Vish&#7751;u being in several passages described as
having created them. The <i>Atharva</i> is here often also referred to
alone, and spoken of with approbation. Its practices are well known and
seldom criticised adversely, magic and sorcery being, as a rule,
regarded as good.</p>
<p>Finally, the Pur&#257;&#7751;as not only regularly speak of the
fourfold Veda, but assign to the <i>Atharva</i> the advanced position
claimed for it by its own ritual literature. Thus the <i>Vish&#7751;u
Pur&#257;&#7751;a</i> connects the <i>Atharva</i> with the fourth
priest (the <i>brahman</i>) of the sacrificial ritual.</p>
<p>Nevertheless a certain prejudice has prevailed against the
<i>Atharva</i> from the time of the Dharma S&#363;tras. This appears
from the fact that, even at the present day, according to Burnell, the
most influential Brahmans of Southern India still refuse to accept the
authority of the fourth Veda, and deny its genuineness. A similar
conclusion may be drawn from occasional statements in classical texts,
and especially from the efforts of the later Atharvan writings
themselves to vindicate the character of their Veda. These ritual texts
not only never enumerate the Vedas without including the
<i>Atharva</i>, but even sometimes place it at the head of the four
Vedas. Under a sense of the exclusion of their Veda from the sphere of
the sacrificial ritual, they lay claim to the fourth priest (the
<i>brahman</i>), who in the Vedic religion was not attached to any of
the three Vedas, but being required to have a knowledge of all three
and of their sacrificial application, acted as superintendent or
director of the sacrificial ceremonial. Ingeniously availing themselves
of the fact that he was unconnected with any of the three Vedas, they
put <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>forward the claim of the fourth Veda as the
special sphere of the fourth priest. That priest, moreover, was the
most important as possessing a universal knowledge of religious lore
(<i>brahma</i>), the comprehensive esoteric understanding of the nature
of the gods and of the mystery of the sacrifice. Hence the <i>Gopatha
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i> exalts the <i>Atharva</i> as the highest
religious lore (<i>brahma</i>), and calls it the <i>Brahmaveda</i>. The
claim to the latter designation was doubtless helped by the word
<i>brahma</i> often occurring in the <i>Atharva-veda</i> itself with
the sense of &ldquo;charm,&rdquo; and by the fact that the Veda
contains a larger amount of theosophic matter (<i>brahmavidy&#257;</i>)
than any other Sam&#803;hit&#257;. The texts belonging to the other
Vedas never suggest that the <i>Atharva</i> is the sphere of the fourth
priest, some Br&#257;hma&#7751;a passages expressly declaring that any
one equipped with the requisite knowledge maybe a <i>brahman</i>. The
ritual texts of the <i>Atharva</i> further energetically urged that the
<i>Purohita</i>, or domestic chaplain, should be a follower of the
<i>Atharva-veda</i>. They appear to have finally succeeded in their
claim to this office, doubtless because kings attached great value to a
special knowledge of witchcraft.</p>
<p>The geographical data contained in the <i>Atharva</i> are but few,
and furnish no certain evidence as to the region in which its hymns
were composed. One hymn of its older portion (v. 22) makes mention of
the Gandh&#257;ris, M&#363;javats, Mah&#257;v&#7771;ishas, and Balhikas
(in the north-west), and the Magadhas and Angas (in the east); but they
are referred to in such a way that no safe conclusions can be drawn as
to the country in which the composer of the hymn in question lived.</p>
<p>The <i>Atharva</i> also contains a few astronomical data, the lunar
mansions being enumerated in the nineteenth <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>book. The names here given deviate considerably
from those mentioned in the <i>Taittir&#299;ya Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i>,
appearing mostly in a later form. The passage in which this list is
found is, however, a late addition.</p>
<p>The language of the <i>Atharva</i> is, from a grammatical point of
view, decidedly later than that of the <i>Rigveda</i>, but earlier than
that of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as. In vocabulary it is chiefly
remarkable for the large number of popular words which it contains, and
which from lack of opportunity do not appear elsewhere.</p>
<p>It seems probable that the hymns of the <i>Atharva</i>, though some
of them must be very old, were not edited till after the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;as of the <i>Rigveda</i> were composed.</p>
<p>On examining the contents of the <i>Atharva-veda</i> more in detail,
we find that the hostile charms it contains are directed largely
against various diseases or the demons which are supposed to cause
them. There are spells to cure fever (<i>takman</i>), leprosy,
jaundice, dropsy, scrofula, cough, ophthalmia, baldness, lack of vital
power; fractures and wounds; the bite of snakes or injurious insects,
and poison in general; mania and other ailments. These charms are
accompanied by the employment of appropriate herbs. Hence the
<i>Atharva</i> is the oldest literary monument of Indian medicine.</p>

attainment of lustre and glory, and in particular for victory in
battle. The following is a specimen of spells intended to strike terror
into the enemy:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">

</div>
<p class="first">Here is a stanza from a hymn (v. 21, 6) to the
battle-drum meant to serve the same purpose:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">As birds start back affrighted at the eagle&rsquo;s

<p class="line">As day and night they tremble at the lion&rsquo;s

<p class="line">So thou, O drum, shout out against our enemies,</p>
<p class="line">Scare them away in terror and confound their minds.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Among the cosmogonic and theosophic hymns the finest
is a long one of sixty-three stanzas addressed to the earth (xii. 1). I
translate a few lines to give some idea of its style and
contents:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">The earth, on whom, with clamour loud,</p>

<p class="line">Granting wealth lavishly, the kindly goddess</p>
<p class="line">Shall goods abundantly bestow upon us.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">The four hymns of Book XIII. are devoted to the praise
of Rohita, the &ldquo;Red&rdquo; Sun, as a cosmogonic power. In another
(xi. 5) the sun is glorified as a primeval principle under the guise of
a Brahman disciple (<i>brahmach&#257;rin</i>). In others
Pr&#257;&#7751;a or Breath (xi. 4), K&#257;ma or Love (ix. 2), and
K&#257;la or Time (xix. 53&ndash;54), <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb201" href="#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span>are personified as
primordial powers. There is one hymn (xi. 7) in which even
Ucchish&#7789;a (the remnant of the sacrifice) is deified as the
Supreme Being; except for its metrical form it belongs to the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a type of literature.</p>
<p>In concluding this survey of the <i>Atharva-veda</i>, I would draw
attention to a hymn to Varu&#7751;a (iv. 16); which, though its last
two stanzas are ordinary Atharvan spells for binding enemies with the
fetters of that deity, in its remaining verses exalts divine
omniscience in a strain unequalled in any other Vedic poem. The
following three stanzas are perhaps the best:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">

<h2 class="main">The Br&#257;hma&#7751;as</h2>
<h2 class="sub">(<i>Circa</i> 800&ndash;500 B.C.)</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The period in which the poetry of the Vedic
Sam&#803;hit&#257;s arose was followed by one which produced a totally
different literary type&mdash;the theological treatises called
Br&#257;hma&#7751;as. It is characteristic of the form of these works
that they are composed in prose, and of their matter that they deal
with the sacrificial ceremonial. Their main object being to explain the
sacred significance of the ritual to those who are already familiar
with the sacrifice, the descriptions they give of it are not
exhaustive, much being stated only in outline or omitted altogether.
They are ritual text-books, which, however, in no way aim at furnishing
a complete survey of the sacrificial ceremonial to those who do not
know it already. Their contents may be classified under the three heads
of practical sacrificial directions (<i>vidhi</i>), explanations
(<i>arthav&#257;da</i>), exegetical, mythological, or polemical, and
theological or philosophical speculations on the nature of things
(<i>upanishad</i>). Even those which have been preserved form quite an
extensive literature by themselves; yet many others must have been
lost, as appears from the numerous names of and quotations from
Br&#257;hma&#7751;as unknown to us occurring in those which are extant.
They reflect the spirit of an age in which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>all
intellectual activity is concentrated on the sacrifice, describing its
ceremonies, discussing its value, speculating on its origin and
significance. It is only reasonable to suppose that an epoch like this,
which produced no other literary monuments, lasted for a considerable
time. For though the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as are on the whole uniform in
character, differences of age are traceable in them. Next to the prose
portions of the <i>Yajurvedas</i>, the <i>Panchavim&#803;&ccedil;a</i>
and the <i>Taittir&#299;ya</i> are proved by their syntax and
vocabulary to be the most archaic of the regular Br&#257;hma&#7751;as.
This conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the latter is, and the
former is known to have been, accented. A more recent group is formed
by the <i>Jaimin&#299;ya</i>, the <i>Kaush&#299;taki</i>, and the
<i>Aitareya Br&#257;hma&#7751;as</i>. The first of these is probably
the oldest, while the third seems, on linguistic grounds at least, to
be the latest of the three. The <i>&Ccedil;atapatha
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>, again, is posterior to these. For it shows a
distinct advance in matter; its use of the narrative tenses is later
than that of the <i>Aitareya</i>; and its style is decidedly developed
in comparison with all the above-mentioned Br&#257;hma&#7751;as. It is,
indeed, accented, but in a way which differs entirely from the regular
Vedic method. Latest of all are the <i>Gopatha Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>
of the <i>Atharva</i> and the short Br&#257;hma&#7751;as of the
<i>S&#257;maveda</i>.</p>
<p>In language the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as are considerably more limited
in the use of forms than the <i>Rigveda</i>. The subjunctive is,
however, still employed, as well as a good many of the old infinitives.
Their syntax, indeed, represents the oldest Indian stage even better
than the <i>Rigveda</i>, chiefly of course owing to the restrictions
imposed by metre on the style of the latter. The Br&#257;hma&#7751;as
contain some metrical pieces (<i>g&#257;th&#257;s</i>), which differ
from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span>the prose in which they are imbedded by certain
peculiarities of their own and by a more archaic character. Allied to
these is a remarkable poem of this period, the
<i>Supar&#7751;&#257;dhy&#257;ya</i>, an attempt, after the age of
living Vedic poetry had come to an end, to compose in the style of the
Vedic hymns. It contains many Vedic forms, and is accented, but it
betrays its true character not only by its many modern forms, but by
numerous monstrosities due to unsuccessful imitation of the Vedic
language.</p>
<p>A further development are the &#256;ra&#7751;yakas or &ldquo;Forest
Treatises,&rdquo; the later age of which is indicated both by the
position they occupy at the end of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as and by
their theosophical character. These works are generally represented as
meant for the use of pious men who have retired to the forest and no
longer perform sacrifices. According to the view of Professor
Oldenberg, they are, however, rather treatises which, owing to the
superior mystic sanctity of their contents, were intended to be
communicated to the pupil by his teacher in the solitude of the forest
instead of in the village.</p>
<p>In tone and content the &#256;ra&#7751;yakas form a transition to
the Upanishads, which are either imbedded in them, or more usually form
their concluding portion. The word <i>upa-ni-shad</i> (literally
&ldquo;sitting down beside&rdquo;) having first doubtless meant
&ldquo;confidential session,&rdquo; came to signify &ldquo;secret or
esoteric doctrine,&rdquo; because these works were taught to select
pupils (probably towards the end of their apprenticeship) in lectures
from which the wider circle was excluded. Being entirely devoted to
theological and philosophical speculations on the nature of things, the
Upanishads mark the last stage of development in the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a literature. As they generally come at the end of
the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as, they are also called <i>Ved&#257;nta</i>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>(&ldquo;end of the Veda&rdquo;), a term later
interpreted to mean &ldquo;final goal of the Veda.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Revelation&rdquo; (<i>&ccedil;ruti</i>) was regarded as
including them, while the S&#363;tras belonged to the sphere of
tradition (<i>sm&#7771;iti</i>). The subject-matter of all the old
Upanishads is essentially the same&mdash;the doctrine of the nature of
the &#256;tman or Brahma (the supreme soul). This fundamental theme was
expounded in various ways by the different Vedic schools, of which the
Upanishads were originally the dogmatic text-books, just as the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;as were their ritual text-books.</p>
<p>The &#256;ra&#7751;yakas and Upanishads represent a phase of
language which on the whole closely approaches to classical Sanskrit,
the oldest Upanishads occupying a position linguistically midway
between the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as and the S&#363;tras.</p>
<p>Of the two Br&#257;hma&#7751;as attached to the <i>Rigveda</i>, the
more important is the <i>Aitareya</i>. The extant text consists of
forty chapters (<i>adhy&#257;ya</i>) divided into eight books called
<i>panchik&#257;s</i> or &ldquo;pentads,&rdquo; because containing five
chapters each. That its last ten chapters were a later addition appears
likely both from internal evidence and from the fact that the closely
related <i>&Ccedil;&#257;nkh&#257;yana Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i> contains
nothing corresponding to their subject-matter, which is dealt with in
the <i>&Ccedil;&#257;nkh&#257;yana S&#363;tra</i>. The last three books
would further appear to have been composed at a later date than the
first five, since the perfect in the former is used as a narrative
tense, while in the latter it still has its original present force, as
in the oldest Br&#257;hma&#7751;as. The essential part of this
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a deals with the soma sacrifice. It treats first
(1&ndash;16) of the soma rite called <i>Agnish&#7789;oma</i>, which
lasts one day, then (17&ndash;18) of that called
<i>Gav&#257;mayana</i>, which lasts 360 days, and thirdly (19&ndash;24)
of the <i>Dv&#257;da&ccedil;&#257;ha</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb206" href="#pb206" name="pb206">206</a>]</span>or &ldquo;twelve
days&rsquo; rite.&rdquo; The next part (25&ndash;32), which is
concerned with the <i>Agnihotra</i> or &ldquo;fire sacrifice&rdquo; and
other matters, has the character of a supplement. The last portion
(33&ndash;40), dealing with the ceremonies of the inauguration of the
king and with the position of his domestic priest, bears similar signs
of lateness.</p>
<p>The other Br&#257;hma&#7751;a of the <i>Rigveda</i>, which goes by
the name of <i>Kaush&#299;taki</i> as well as
<i>&Ccedil;&#257;nkh&#257;yana</i>, consists of thirty chapters. Its
subject-matter is, on the whole, the same as that of the original part
of the <i>Aitareya</i> (i.&ndash;v.), but is wider. For in its opening
chapters it goes through the setting up of the sacred fire
(<i>agni-&#257;dh&#257;na</i>), the daily morning and evening sacrifice
(<i>agnihotra</i>), the new and full moon ritual, and the four-monthly
sacrifices. The Soma sacrifice, however, occupies the chief position
even here. The more definite and methodical treatment of the ritual in
the <i>Kaush&#299;taki</i> would seem to indicate that this
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a was composed at a later date than the first five
books of the <i>Aitareya</i>. Such a conclusion is, however, not
altogether borne out by a comparison of the linguistic data of these
two works. Professor Weber argues from the occurrence in one passage of
&#298;&ccedil;&#257;na and Mah&#257;deva as designations of the god who
was later exclusively called &Ccedil;iva, that the <i>Kaush&#299;taki
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i> was composed at about the same time as the
latest books of the <i>White Yajurveda</i> and those parts of the
<i>Atharva-veda</i> and of the <i>&Ccedil;atapatha
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i> in which these appellations of the same god are
found.</p>
<p>These Br&#257;hma&#7751;as contain very few geographical data. From
the way, however, in which the <i>Aitareya</i> mentions the Indian
tribes, it may be safely inferred that this work had its origin in the
country of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name=
"pb207">207</a>]</span>Kuru-Panch&#257;las, in which, as we have seen,
the Vedic ritual must have been developed, and the hymns of the
<i>Rigveda</i> were probably collected in the existing
Sam&#803;hit&#257;. From the <i>Kaush&#299;taki</i> we learn that the
study of language was specially cultivated in the north of India, and
that students who returned from there were regarded as authorities on
linguistic questions.</p>
<p>The chief human interest of these Br&#257;hma&#7751;as lies in the
numerous myths and legends which they contain. The longest and most
remarkable of those found in the <i>Aitareya</i> is the story of
&Ccedil;unah&#803;&ccedil;epa (Dog&rsquo;s-Tail), which forms the third
chapter of Book VII. The childless King Hari&ccedil;chandra vowed, if
he should have a son, to sacrifice him to Varu&#7751;a. But when his
son Rohita was born, he kept putting off the fulfilment of his promise.
At length, when the boy was grown up, his father, pressed by
Varu&#7751;a, prepared to perform the sacrifice. Rohita, however,
escaped to the forest, where he wandered for six years, while his
father was afflicted with dropsy by Varu&#7751;a. At last he fell in
with a starving Brahman, who consented to sell to him for a hundred
cows his son &Ccedil;unah&#803;&ccedil;epa as a substitute.
Varu&#7751;a agreed, saying, &ldquo;A Brahman is worth more than a
Kshatriya.&rdquo; &Ccedil;unah&#803;&ccedil;epa was accordingly bound
to the stake, and the sacrifice was about to proceed, when the victim
prayed to various gods in succession. As he repeated one verse after
the other, the fetters of Varu&#7751;a began to fall off and the
dropsical swelling of the king to diminish, till finally
&Ccedil;unah&#803;&ccedil;epa was released and Hari&ccedil;chandra was
restored to health again.</p>
<p>The style of the prose in which the <i>Aitareya</i> is composed is
crude, clumsy, abrupt, and elliptical. The following quotation from the
stanzas interspersed in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href=
"#pb208" name="pb208">208</a>]</span>story of
&Ccedil;unah&#803;&ccedil;epa may serve as a specimen of the
<i>g&#257;th&#257;s</i> found in the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as. These verses
are addressed by a sage named N&#257;rada to King Hari&ccedil;chandra
on the importance of having a son:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">

</div>
</div>
<p class="first">To the <i>Aitareya Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i> belongs the
<i>Aitareya &#256;ra&#7751;yaka</i>. It consists of eighteen chapters,
distributed unequally among five books. The last two books are composed
in the S&#363;tra style, and are really to be regarded as belonging to
the S&#363;tra literature. Four parts can be clearly distinguished in
the first three books. Book I. deals with various liturgies of the Soma
sacrifice from a purely ritual point of view. The first three chapters
of Book II., on the other hand, are theosophical in character,
containing speculations about the world-soul under the names of
Pr&#257;&#7751;a and Purusha. It is allied in matter to the Upanishads,
some of its more valuable thoughts recurring, occasionally even word
for word, in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209"
name="pb209">209</a>]</span><i>Kaush&#299;taki Upanishad</i>. The third
part consists of the remaining four sections of Book II., which form
the regular <i>Aitareya Upanishad</i>. Finally, Book III. deals with
the mystic and allegorical meaning of the three principal modes in
which the Veda is recited in the <i>Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i>, <i>Pada</i>
and <i>Krama P&#257;&#7789;has</i>, and of the various letters of the
alphabet.</p>
<p>To the <i>Kaush&#299;taki Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i> is attached the
<i>Kaush&#299;taki &#256;ra&#7751;yaka</i>. It consists of fifteen
chapters. The first two of these correspond to Books I. and V. of the
<i>Aitareya &#256;ra&#7751;yaka</i>, the seventh and eighth to Book
III., while the intervening four chapters (3&ndash;6) form the
<i>Kaush&#299;taki Upanishad</i>. The latter is a long and very
interesting Upanishad. It seems not improbably to have been added as an
independent treatise to the completed &#256;ra&#7751;yaka, as it is not
always found in the same part of the latter work in the
manuscripts.</p>
<p>Br&#257;hma&#7751;as belonging to two independent schools of the
<i>S&#257;maveda</i> have been preserved, those of the
T&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ins and of the Talavak&#257;ras or
Jaimin&#299;yas. Though several other works here claim the title of
ritual text-books, only three are in reality Br&#257;hma&#7751;as. The
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a of the Talavak&#257;ras, which for the most part is
still unpublished, seems to consist of five books. The first three
(unpublished) are mainly concerned with various parts of the
sacrificial ceremonial. The fourth book, called the <i>Upanishad
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i> (probably &ldquo;the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a of
mystic meanings&rdquo;), besides all kinds of allegories of the
&#256;ra&#7751;yaka order, two lists of teachers, a section about the
origin of the vital airs (<i>pr&#257;&#7751;a</i>) and about the
<i>s&#257;vitr&#299;</i> stanza, contains the brief but important
<i>Kena Upanishad</i>. Book V., entitled
<i>&#256;rsheya-Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>, is a short enumeration of the
composers of the <i>S&#257;maveda</i>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb210" href="#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span></p>
<p>To the school of the T&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ins belongs the
<i>Panchavim&#803;&ccedil;a</i> (&ldquo;twenty-five fold&rdquo;), also
called <i>T&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ya</i> or <i>Prau&#7693;ha</i>,
<i>Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>, which, as the first name implies, consists
of twenty-five books. It is concerned with the Soma sacrifices in
general, ranging from the minor offerings to those which lasted a
hundred days, or even several years. Besides many legends, it contains
a minute description of sacrifices performed on the Sarasvat&#299; and
D&#7771;ishadvat&#299;. Though Kurukshetra is known to it, other
geographical data which it contains point to the home of this
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a having lain farther east. Noteworthy among its
contents are the so-called <i>Vr&#257;tya-Stomas</i>, which are
sacrifices meant to enable Aryan but non-Brahmanical Indians to enter
the Brahmanical order. A point of interest in this Br&#257;hma&#7751;a
is the bitter hostility which it displays towards the school of the
Kaush&#299;takins. The <i>Sha&#7693;vim&#803;&ccedil;a
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>, though nominally an independent work, is in
reality a supplement to the <i>Panchavim&#803;&ccedil;a</i>, of which,
as its name implies, it forms the twenty-sixth book. The last of its
six chapters is called the <i>Adbhuta Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>, which is
intended to obviate the evil effects of various extraordinary events or
portents. Among such phenomena are mentioned images of the gods when
they laugh, cry, sing, dance, perspire, crack, and so forth.</p>
<p>The other Br&#257;hma&#7751;a of this school, the <i>Chh&#257;ndogya
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>, is only to a slight extent a ritual text-book.
It does not deal with the Soma sacrifice at all, but only with
ceremonies relating to birth and marriage or prayers addressed to
divine beings. These are the contents of only the first two
&ldquo;lessons&rdquo; of this Br&#257;hma&#7751;a of the S&#257;ma
theologians. The remaining eight lessons constitute the
<i>Chh&#257;ndogya Upanishad</i>.</p>
<p>There are four other short works which, though bearing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span>the
name, are not really Br&#257;hma&#7751;as. These are the
<i>S&#257;mavidh&#257;na Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>, a treatise on the
employment of chants for all kinds of superstitious purposes; the
<i>Devat&#257;dhy&#257;ya Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>, containing some
statements about the deities of the various chants of the
<i>S&#257;maveda</i>; the <i>Vam&#803;&ccedil;a
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>, which furnishes a genealogy of the teachers of
the <i>S&#257;maveda</i>; and, finally, the
<i>Sam&#803;hitopanishad</i>, which, like the third book of the
<i>Aitareya &#256;ra&#7751;yaka</i>, treats of the way in which the
Veda should be recited.</p>
<p>The Br&#257;hma&#7751;as of the <i>S&#257;maveda</i> are
distinguished by the exaggerated and fantastic character of their
mystical speculations. A prominent feature in them is the constant
identification of various kinds of <i>S&#257;mans</i> or chants with
all kinds of terrestrial and celestial objects. At the same time they
contain much matter that is interesting from a historical point of
view.</p>
<p>In the <i>Black Yajurveda</i> the prose portions of the various
Sam&#803;hit&#257;s form the only Br&#257;hma&#7751;as in the
Ka&#7789;ha and the Maitr&#257;ya&#7751;&#299;ya schools. In the
Taittir&#299;ya school they form the oldest and most important
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a. Here we have also the <i>Taittir&#299;ya
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i> as an independent work in three books. This,
however, hardly differs in character from the <i>Taittir&#299;ya
Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i>, being rather a continuation. It forms a
supplement concerned with a few sacrifices omitted in the
Sam&#803;hit&#257;, or handles, with greater fulness of detail, matters
already dealt with. There is also a <i>Taittir&#299;ya
&#256;ra&#7751;yaka</i>, which in its turn forms a supplement to the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a. The last four of its ten sections constitute the
two Upanishads of this school, vii.&ndash;ix. forming the
<i>Taittir&#299;ya Upanishad</i>, and x. the
<i>Mah&#257;-N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a Upanishad</i>, also called the
<i>Y&#257;jnik&#299; Upanishad</i>. Excepting these four sections, the
title of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span>Br&#257;hma&#7751;a or &#256;ra&#7751;yaka does
not indicate a difference of content as compared with the
Sam&#803;hit&#257;, but is due to late and artificial imitation of the
other Vedas.</p>
<p>The last three sections of Book III. of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a, as
well as the first two books of the &#256;ra&#7751;yaka, originally
belonged to the school of the Ka&#7789;has, though they have not been
preserved as part of the tradition of that school. The different origin
of these parts is indicated by the absence of the change of <i>y</i>
and <i>v</i> to <i>iy</i> and <i>uv</i> respectively, which otherwise
prevails in the <i>Taittir&#299;ya Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i> and
<i>&#256;ra&#7751;yaka</i>. In one of these K&#257;&#7789;haka sections
(<i>Taitt. Br.</i> iii. 11), by way of illustrating the significance of
the particular fire called <i>n&#257;chiketa</i>, the story is told of
a boy, Nachiketas, who, on visiting the House of Death, was granted the
fulfilment of three wishes by the god of the dead. On this story is
based the <i>K&#257;&#7789;haka Upanishad</i>.</p>
<p>Though the <i>Maitr&#257;ya&#7751;&#299; Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i> has
no independent Br&#257;hma&#7751;a, its fourth book, as consisting of
explanations and supplements to the first three, is a kind of special
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a. Connected with this Sam&#803;hit&#257;, and in the
manuscripts sometimes forming its second or its fifth book, is the
<i>Maitr&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> (also called
<i>Maitr&#257;ya&#7751;&#299;ya</i> and <i>Maitri</i>)
<i>Upanishad</i>.</p>
<p>The ritual explanation of the <i>White Yajurveda</i> is to be found
in extraordinary fulness in the <i>&Ccedil;atapatha
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</i>, the &ldquo;Br&#257;hma&#7751;a of the Hundred
Paths,&rdquo; so called because it consists of one hundred lectures
(<i>adhy&#257;ya</i>). This work is, next to the <i>Rigveda</i>, the
most important production in the whole range of Vedic literature. Its
text has come down in two recensions, those of the
M&#257;dhyam&#803;dina school, edited by Professor Weber, and of the
K&#257;&#7751;va school, which is in process of being edited by
Professor Eggeling. The M&#257;dhyam&#803;dina recension consists
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name=
"pb213">213</a>]</span>of fourteen books, while the K&#257;&#7751;va
has seventeen. The first nine of the former, corresponding to the
original eighteen books of the <i>V&#257;jasaneyi
Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i>, doubtless form the oldest part. The fact that
Book XII. is called <i>madhyama</i>, or &ldquo;middle one,&rdquo; shows
that the last five books (or possibly only X.&ndash;XIII.) were at one
time regarded as a separate part of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a. Book X.
treats of the mystery of the fire-altar (<i>agnirahasya</i>), XI. is a
sort of recapitulation of the preceding ritual, while XII. and XIII.
deal with various supplementary matters. The last book forms the
&#256;ra&#7751;yaka, the six concluding chapters of which are the
<i>B&#7771;ihad&#257;ra&#7751;yaka Upanishad</i>.</p>
<p>Books VI.&ndash;X. of the <i>&Ccedil;atapatha
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i> occupy a peculiar position. Treating of the
construction of the fire-altar, they recognise the teaching of
&Ccedil;&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ilya as their highest authority,
Y&#257;jnavalkya not even being mentioned; while the peoples who are
named, the G&#257;ndh&#257;ras, Salvas, Kekayas, belong to the
north-west. In the other books Y&#257;jnavalkya is the highest
authority, while hardly any but Eastern peoples, or those of the middle
of Hindustan, the Kuru-Panch&#257;las, Kosalas, Videhas,
S&#7771;injayas, are named. That the original authorship of the five
&Ccedil;&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ilya books was different from that of the
others is indicated by a number of linguistic differences, which the
hand of a later editor failed to remove. Thus the use of the perfect as
a narrative tense is unknown to the &Ccedil;&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ilya
books (as well as to XIII.).</p>
<p>The geographical data of the <i>&Ccedil;atapatha
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i> point to the land of the Kuru-Panch&#257;las
being still the centre of Brahmanical culture. Janamejaya is here
celebrated as a king of the Kurus, and the most renowned Brahmanical
teacher of the age, &#256;ru&#7751;i, is expressly stated to have been
a Panch&#257;la. Nevertheless, it is clear that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span>the
Brahmanical system had by this time spread to the countries to the east
of Madhyade&ccedil;a, to Kosala, with its capital, Ayodhy&#257; (Oudh),
and Videha (Tirhut or Northern Behar), with its capital, Mithil&#257;.
The court of King Janaka of Videha was thronged with Brahmans from the
Kuru-Panch&#257;la country. The tournaments of argument which were here
held form a prominent feature in the later books of the
<i>&Ccedil;atapatha Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>. The hero of these is
Y&#257;jnavalkya, who, himself a pupil of &#256;ru&#7751;i, is regarded
as the chief spiritual authority in the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a (excepting
Books VI.&ndash;X.). Certain passages of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a render
it highly probable that Y&#257;jnavalkya was a native of Videha. The
fact that its leading authority, who thus appears to have belonged to
this Eastern country, is represented as vanquishing the most
distinguished teachers of the West in argument, points to the redaction
of the <i>White Yajurveda</i> having taken place in this eastern
region.</p>
<p>The <i>&Ccedil;atapatha Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i> contains
reminiscences of the days when the country of Videha was not as yet
Brahmanised. Thus Book I. relates a legend in which three stages in the
eastward migration of the Aryans can be clearly distinguished.
M&#257;&#7789;hava, the king of Videgha (the older form of Videha),
whose family priest was Gotama R&#257;h&#363;ga&#7751;a, was at one
time on the Sarasvat&#299;. Agni Vai&ccedil;v&#257;nara (here typical
of Brahmanical culture) thence went burning along this earth towards
the east, followed by M&#257;&#7789;hava and his priest, till he came
to the river Sad&#257;n&#299;ra (probably the modern Gandak, a
tributary running into the Ganges near Patna), which flows from the
northern mountain, and which he did not burn over. This river Brahmans
did not cross in former times, thinking &ldquo;it has not been burnt
over by Agni Vai&ccedil;v&#257;nara.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name="pb215">215</a>]</span>At
that time the land to the eastward was very uncultivated and marshy,
but now many Brahmans are there, and it is highly cultivated, for the
Brahmans have caused Agni to taste it through sacrifices.
M&#257;&#7789;hava the Videgha then said to Agni, &ldquo;Where am I to
abide?&rdquo; &ldquo;To the east of this river be thy abode,&rdquo; he
replied. Even now, the writer adds, this river forms the boundary
between the Kosalas (Oudh) and the Videhas (Tirhut).</p>
<p>The V&#257;jasaneyi school of the <i>White Yajurveda</i> evidently
felt a sense of the superiority of their sacrificial lore, which grew
up in these eastern countries. Blame is frequently expressed in the
<i>&Ccedil;atapatha Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i> of the Adhvaryu priests of
the Charaka school. The latter is meant as a comprehensive term
embracing the three older schools of the <i>Black Yajurveda</i>, the
Ka&#7789;has, the Kapish&#7789;halas, and the
Maitr&#257;ya&#7751;&#299;yas.</p>
<p>As Buddhism first obtained a firm footing in Kosala and Videha, it
is interesting to inquire in what relation the <i>&Ccedil;atapatha
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i> stands to the beginnings of that doctrine. In
this connection it is to be noted that the words <i>Arhat</i>,
<i>&Ccedil;ramana</i>, and <i>Pratibuddha</i> occur here for the first
time, but as yet without the technical sense which they have in
Buddhistic literature. Again, in the lists of teachers given in the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a mention is made with special frequency of the
Gautamas, a family name used by the &Ccedil;&#257;kyas of Kapilavastu,
among whom Buddha was born. Certain allusions are also suggestive of
the beginnings of the S&#257;nkhya doctrine; for mention is several
times made of a teacher called &#256;suri, and according to tradition
&#256;suri is the name of a leading authority for the S&#257;nkhya
system. If we inquire as to how far the legends of our
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a contain the germs of the later epic tales, we find
that there is indeed some slight connection. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>Janamejaya, the celebrated king of the Kurus in
the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>, is mentioned here for the first time.
The P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;us, however, who proved victorious in the epic
war, are not to be met with in this any more than in the other
Br&#257;hma&#7751;as; and Arjuna, the name of their chief, is still an
appellation of Indra. But as the epic Arjuna is a son of Indra, his
origin is doubtless to be traced to this epithet of Indra. Janaka, the
famous king of Videha, is in all probability identical with the father
of S&#299;t&#257;, the heroine of the
<i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i>.</p>
<p>Of two legends which furnished the classical poet K&#257;lid&#257;sa
with the plots of two of his most famous dramas, one is told in detail,
and the other is at least alluded to. The story of the love and
separation of Pur&#363;ravas and Urva&ccedil;&#299;, already dimly
shadowed forth in a hymn of the <i>Rigveda</i>, is here related with
much more fulness; while Bharata, son of Duh&#803;shanta and of the
nymph &Ccedil;akuntal&#257;, also appears on the scene in this
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</p>
<p>A most interesting legend which reappears in the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>, that of the Deluge, is here told for the
first time in Indian literature, though it seems to be alluded to in
the <i>Atharva-veda</i>, while it is known even to the Avesta. This
myth is generally regarded as derived from a Semitic source. It tells
how Manu once came into possession of a small fish, which asked him to
rear it, and promised to save him from the coming flood. Having built a
ship in accordance with the fish&rsquo;s advice, he entered it when the
deluge arose, and was finally guided to the Northern Mountain by the
fish, to whose horn he had tied his ship. Manu subsequently became the
progenitor of mankind through his daughter. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span></p>
<p>The <i>&Ccedil;atapatha Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i> is thus a mine of
important data and noteworthy narratives. Internal evidence shows it to
belong to a late period of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a age. Its style, as
compared with the earlier works of the same class, displays some
progress towards facility and clearness. Its treatment of the
sacrificial ceremonial, which is essentially the same in the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a portions of the <i>Black Yajurveda</i>, is
throughout more lucid and systematic. On the theosophic side, too, we
find the idea of the unity in the universe more fully developed than in
any other Br&#257;hma&#7751;a work, while its Upanishad is the finest
product of Vedic philosophy.</p>
<p>To the <i>Atharva-veda</i> is attached the <i>Gopatha
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>, though it has no particular connection with
that Sam&#803;hit&#257;. This Br&#257;hma&#7751;a consists of two
books, the first containing five chapters, the second six. Both parts
are very late, for they were composed after the <i>Vait&#257;na
S&#363;tra</i> and practically without any Atharvan tradition. The
matter of the former half, while not corresponding or following the
order of the sacrifice in any ritual text, is to a considerable extent
original, the rest being borrowed from Books XI. and XII. of the
<i>&Ccedil;atapatha Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>, besides a few passages
from the <i>Aitareya</i>. The main motive of this portion is the
glorification of the <i>Atharva-veda</i> and of the fourth or
<i>brahman</i> priest. The mention of the god &Ccedil;iva points to its
belonging to the post-Vedic rather than to the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a
period. Its presupposing the <i>Atharva-veda</i> in twenty books, and
containing grammatical matters of a very advanced type, are other signs
of lateness. The latter half bears more the stamp of a regular
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a, being a fairly connected account of the ritual in
the sacrificial order of the <i>Vait&#257;na &Ccedil;rauta
S&#363;tra</i>; but it is for the most part a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span>compilation. The ordinary historical relation of
Br&#257;hma&#7751;&#257; and S&#363;tra is here reversed, the second
book of the <i>Gopatha Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i> being based on the
<i>Vait&#257;na S&#363;tra</i>, which stands to it practically in the
relation of a Sam&#803;hit&#257;. About two-thirds of its matter have
already been shown to be taken from older texts. The <i>Aitareya</i>
and <i>Kaush&#299;taki Br&#257;hma&#7751;</i>as have been chiefly
exploited, and to a less extent the <i>Maitr&#257;ya&#7751;&#299;</i>
and <i>Taittir&#299;ya Sam&#803;hit&#257;s</i>. A few passages are
derived from the <i>&Ccedil;atapatha</i>, and even the
<i>Panchavim&#803;&ccedil;a Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>.</p>
<p>Though the Upanishads generally form a part of the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;as, being a continuation of their speculative side
(<i>jn&#257;na-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</i>), they really represent a new
religion, which is in virtual opposition to the ritual or practical
side (<i>karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</i>). Their aim is no longer the
obtainment of earthly happiness and afterwards bliss in the abode of
Yama by sacrificing correctly to the gods, but release from mundane
existence by the absorption of the individual soul in the world-soul
through correct knowledge. Here, therefore, the sacrificial ceremonial
has become useless and speculative knowledge all-important.</p>
<p>The essential theme of the Upanishads is the nature of the
world-soul. Their conception of it represents the final stage in the
development from the world-man, Purusha, of the <i>Rigveda</i> to the
world-soul, &#256;tman; from the personal creator, Praj&#257;pati, to
the impersonal source of all being, Brahma. <i>&#256;tman</i> in the
<i>Rigveda</i> means no more than &ldquo;breath&rdquo;; wind, for
instance, being spoken of as the <i>&#257;tman</i> of Varu&#7751;a. In
the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as it came to mean &ldquo;soul&rdquo; or
&ldquo;self.&rdquo; In one of their speculations the
<i>pr&#257;&#7751;as</i> or &ldquo;vital airs,&rdquo; which are
supposed to be based on the <i>&#257;tman</i>, are identified with the
gods, and so an <i>&#257;tman</i> comes to be attributed to the
universe. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>In one of the later books of the
<i>&Ccedil;atapatha Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i> (X. vi. 3) this
<i>&#257;tman</i>, which has already arrived at a high degree of
abstraction, is said to &ldquo;pervade this universe.&rdquo;
<i>Brahma</i> (neuter) in the <i>Rigveda</i> signified nothing more
than &ldquo;prayer&rdquo; or &ldquo;devotion.&rdquo; But even in the
oldest Br&#257;hma&#7751;as it has come to have the sense of
&ldquo;universal holiness,&rdquo; as manifested in prayer, priest, and
sacrifice. In the Upanishads it is the holy principle which animates
nature. Having a long subsequent history, this word is a very epitome
of the evolution of religious thought in India. These two conceptions,
&#256;tman and Brahma, are commonly treated as synonymous in the
Upanishads. But, strictly speaking, Brahma, the older term, represents
the cosmical principle which pervades the universe, &#256;tman the
psychical principle manifested in man; and the latter, as the known, is
used to explain the former as the unknown. The &#256;tman under the
name of the Eternal (<i>aksharam</i>) is thus described in the
<i>B&#7771;ihad&#257;ra&#7751;yaka Upanishad</i> (III. viii. 8,
11):&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;<i>It is not large, and not minute; not short,
not long; without blood, without fat; without shadow, without darkness;
without wind, without ether; not adhesive, not tangible; without smell,
without taste; without eyes, ears, voice, or mind; without heat,
breath, or mouth; without personal or family name; unaging, undying,
without fear, immortal, dustless, not uncovered or covered; with
nothing before, nothing behind, nothing within. It consumes no one and
is consumed by no one. It is the unseen seer, the unheard hearer, the
unthought thinker, the unknown knower. There is no other seer, no other
hearer, no other thinker, no other knower. That is the Eternal in which
space</i> (&#257;k&#257;&ccedil;a) <i>is woven and which is interwoven
with it.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span></p>
<p>Here, for the first time in the history of human thought, we find
the Absolute grasped and proclaimed.</p>
<p>A poetical account of the nature of the &#256;tman is given by the
<i>K&#257;&#7789;haka Upanishad</i> in the following
stanzas:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">That whence the sun&rsquo;s orb rises up,</p>
<p class="line">And that in which it sinks again:</p>
<p class="line">In it the gods are all contained,</p>
<p class="line">Beyond it none can ever pass <span class="rm">(iv.
9).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Its form can never be to sight apparent,</p>
<p class="line">Not any one may with his eye behold it:</p>
<p class="line">By heart and mind and soul alone they grasp it,</p>
<p class="line">And those who know it thus become immortal <span class=
"rm">(vi. 9).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Since not by speech and not by thought,</p>
<p class="line">Not by the eye can it be reached:</p>
<p class="line">How else may it be understood</p>
<p class="line">But only when one says &ldquo;it is&rdquo;?
<span class="rm">(vi. 12).</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">The place of the more personal Praj&#257;pati is taken
in the Upanishads by the &#256;tman as a creative power. Thus the
<i>B&#7771;ihad&#257;ra&#7751;yaka</i> (I. iv.) relates that in the
beginning the &#256;tman or the Brahma was this universe. It was afraid
in its loneliness and felt no pleasure. Desiring a second being, it
became man and woman, whence the human race was produced. It then
proceeded to produce male and female animals in a similar way; finally
creating water, fire, the gods, and so forth. The author then proceeds
in a more exalted strain:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first"><i>&ldquo;It (the &#256;tman) is here all-pervading
down to the tips of the nails. One does not see it any more than a
razor hidden in its case or fire in its receptacle. For it does not
appear as a whole. When it breathes, it is called breath; when it
speaks, voice; when it hears, ear; when it thinks, mind. These are
merely the names of its activities. He <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb221" href="#pb221" name="pb221">221</a>]</span>who worships the one
or the other of these, has not (correct) knowledge.... One should
worship it as the Self. For in it all these (breath, etc.) become
one.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>In one of the later Upanishads, the
<i>&Ccedil;vet&#257;&ccedil;vatara</i> (iv. 10), the notion, so
prominent in the later Ved&#257;nta system, that the material world is
an illusion (<i>m&#257;y&#257;</i>), is first met with. The world is
here explained as an illusion produced by Brahma as a conjuror
(<i>m&#257;yin</i>). This notion is, however, inherent even in the
oldest Upanishads. It is virtually identical with the teaching of Plato
that the things of experience are only the shadow of the real things,
and with the teaching of Kant, that they are only phenomena of the
thing in itself.</p>
<p>The great fundamental doctrine of the Upanishads is the identity of
the individual <i>&#257;tman</i> with the world <i>&#256;tman</i>. It
is most forcibly expressed in a frequently repeated sentence of the
<i>Chh&#257;ndogya Upanishad</i> (vi. 8&ndash;16): &ldquo;<i>This whole
world consists of it: that is the Real, that is the Soul, that art
thou, O &Ccedil;vetaketu.</i>&rdquo; In that famous formula,
&ldquo;That art thou&rdquo; (<i>tat tvam asi</i>), all the teachings of
the Upanishads are summed up. The
<i>B&#7771;ihad&#257;ra&#7751;yaka</i> (I. iv. 6) expresses the same
doctrine thus: &ldquo;<i>Whoever knows this, &lsquo;I am
brahma&rsquo;</i> (aham brahma asmi), <i>becomes the All. Even the gods
are not able to prevent him from becoming it. For he becomes their
Self</i> (&#257;tman).&rdquo;</p>
<p>This identity was already recognised in the <i>&Ccedil;atapatha
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i> (X. vi. 3): &ldquo;<i>Even as the smallest
granule of millet, so is this golden Purusha in the heart</i>....
<i>That self of the spirit is my self: on passing from hence I shall
obtain that Self.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>We find everywhere in these treatises a restless striving to grasp
the true nature of the pantheistic Self, now through one metaphor, now
through another. Thus <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href=
"#pb222" name="pb222">222</a>]</span>(<i>B&#7771;ih. Up.</i> II. iv.)
the wise Y&#257;jnavalkya, about to renounce the world and retire to
the forest, replies to the question of his wife, Maitrey&#299;, with
the words: &ldquo;<i>As a lump of salt thrown into the water would
dissolve and could not be taken out again, while the water, wherever
tasted, would be salt, so is this great being endless, unlimited,
simply compacted of cognition. Arising out of these elements, it
disappears again in them. After death there is no
consciousness</i>;&rdquo; for, as he further explains, when the duality
on which consciousness is based disappears, consciousness must
necessarily cease.</p>
<p>In another passage of the same Upanishad (II. i. 20) we read:
&ldquo;<i>Just as the spider goes out of itself by means of its thread,
as tiny sparks leap out of the fire, so from the &#256;tman issue all
vital airs, all worlds, all gods, all beings.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, again, is a stanza from the <i>Mu&#7751;&#7693;aka</i> (III.
ii. 8):&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">As rivers flow and disappear at last</p>
<p class="line">In ocean&rsquo;s waters, name and form renouncing,</p>
<p class="line">So, too, the sage, released from name and form,</p>
<p class="line">Is merged in the divine and highest spirit.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In a passage of the
<i>B&#7771;ihad&#257;ra&#7751;yaka</i> (III. vii.) Y&#257;jnavalkya
describes the &#256;tman as the &ldquo;inner guide&rdquo;
(<i>antary&#257;min</i>): &ldquo;<i>Who is in all beings, different
from all beings, who guides all beings within, that is thy Self, the
inward guide, immortal.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same Upanishad contains an interesting conversation, in which
King Aj&#257;ta&ccedil;atru of K&#257;&ccedil;i (Benares) instructs the
Brahman, B&#257;l&#257;ki G&#257;rgya, that Brahma is not the spirit
(<i>purusha</i>) which is in sun, moon, wind, and other natural
phenomena, or even in the (waking) soul (<i>&#257;tman</i>), but is
either the dreaming soul, which is creative, assuming any form at
pleasure, or, in the highest stage, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb223" href="#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span>soul in dreamless
sleep, for here all phenomena have disappeared. This is the first and
the last condition of Brahma, in which no world exists, all material
existence being only the phantasms of the dreaming world-soul.</p>
<p>Of somewhat similar purport is a passage of the
<i>Chh&#257;ndogya</i> (viii. 7&ndash;12), where Praj&#257;pati is
represented as teaching the nature of the &#256;tman in three stages.
The soul in the body as reflected in a mirror or water is first
identified with Brahma, then the dreaming soul, and, lastly, the soul
in dreamless sleep.</p>
<p>How generally accepted the pantheistic theory must have become by
the time the disputations at the court of King Janaka took place, is
indicated by the form in which questions are put. Thus two different
sages in the <i>B&#7771;ihad&#257;ra&#7751;yaka</i> (iii. 4, 5)
successively ask Y&#257;jnavalkya in the same words: &ldquo;<i>Explain
to us the Brahma which is manifest and not hidden, the &#256;tman that
dwells in everything.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the doctrine that true knowledge led to supreme bliss by the
absorption of the individual soul in Brahma went hand in hand the
theory of transmigration (<i>sam&#803;s&#257;ra</i>). That theory is
developed in the oldest Upanishads; it must have been firmly
established by the time Buddhism arose, for Buddha accepted it without
question. Its earliest form is found in the <i>&Ccedil;atapatha
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>, where the notion of being born again after
death and dying repeatedly is coupled with that of retribution. Thus it
is here said that those who have correct knowledge and perform a
certain sacrifice are born again after death for immortality, while
those who have not such knowledge and do not perform this sacrifice are
reborn again and again, becoming the prey of Death. The notion here
expressed does not go beyond repeated <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb224" href="#pb224" name="pb224">224</a>]</span>births and deaths in
the next world. It is transformed to the doctrine of transmigration in
the Upanishads by supposing rebirth to take place in this world. In the
<i>B&#7771;ihad&#257;ra&#7751;yaka</i> we further meet with the
beginnings of the doctrine of <i>karma</i>, or &ldquo;action,&rdquo;
which regulates the new birth, and makes it depend on a man&rsquo;s own
deeds. When the body returns to the elements, nothing of the
individuality is here said to remain but the <i>karma</i>, according to
which a man becomes good or bad. This is, perhaps, the germ of the
Buddhistic doctrine, which, though denying the existence of soul
altogether, allows <i>karma</i> to continue after death and to
determine the next birth.</p>
<p>The most important and detailed account of the theory of
transmigration which we possess from Vedic times is supplied by the
<i>Chh&#257;ndogya Upanishad</i>. The forest ascetic possessed of
knowledge and faith, it is here said, after death enters the
<i>devay&#257;na</i>, the &ldquo;path of the gods,&rdquo; which leads
to absorption in Brahma, while the householder who has performed
sacrifice and good works goes by the <i>pit&#7771;iy&#257;&#7751;a</i>
or &ldquo;path of the Fathers&rdquo; to the moon, where he remains till
the consequences of his actions are exhausted. He then returns to
earth, being first born again as a plant and afterwards as a man of one
of the three highest castes. Here we have a double retribution, first
in the next world, then by transmigration in this. The former is a
survival of the old Vedic belief about the future life. The wicked are
born again as outcasts (<i>cha&#7751;&#7693;&#257;las</i>), dogs or
swine.</p>
<p>The account of the <i>B&#7771;ihad&#257;ra&#7751;yaka</i> (VI. ii.
15&ndash;16) is similar. Those who have true knowledge and faith pass
through the world of the gods and the sun to the world of Brahma,
whence there is no return. Those who practise sacrifice and good works
pass through the world of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href=
"#pb225" name="pb225">225</a>]</span>the Fathers to the moon, whence
they return to earth, being born again as men. Others become birds,
beasts, and reptiles.</p>
<p>The view of the <i>Kaush&#299;taki Upanishad</i> (i. 2&ndash;3) is
somewhat different. Here all who die go to the moon, whence some go by
the &ldquo;path of the Fathers&rdquo; to Brahma, while others return to
various forms of earthly existence, ranging from man to worm, according
to the quality of their works and the degree of their knowledge.</p>
<p>The <i>K&#257;&#7789;haka</i>, one of the most remarkable and
beautiful of the Upanishads, treats the question of life after death in
the form of a legend. Nachiketas, a young Brahman, visits the realm of
Yama, who offers him the choice of three boons. For the third he
chooses the answer to the question, whether man exists after death or
no. Death replies: &ldquo;Even the gods have doubted about this; it is
a subtle point; choose another boon.&rdquo; After vain efforts to evade
the question by offering Nachiketas earthly power and riches, Yama at
last yields to his persistence and reveals the secret. Life and death,
he explains, are only different phases of development. True knowledge,
which consists in recognising the identity of the individual soul with
the world soul, raises its possessor beyond the reach of
death:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">When every passion vanishes</p>
<p class="line">That nestles in the human heart,</p>
<p class="line">Then man gains immortality,</p>
<p class="line">Then Brahma is obtained by him <span class="rm">(vi.
14).</span></p>
</div>
<p class="first">The story of the temptation of Nachiketas to choose
the goods of this world in preference to the highest knowledge is
probably the prototype of the legend of the temptation of Buddha by
M&#257;ra or Death. Both by resisting the temptation obtain
enlightenment. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226</a>]</span></p>
<p>It must not of course be supposed that the Upanishads, either as a
whole or individually, offer a complete and consistent conception of
the world logically developed. They are rather a mixture of
half-poetical, half-philosophical fancies, of dialogues and
disputations dealing tentatively with metaphysical questions. Their
speculations were only later reduced to a system in the Ved&#257;nta
philosophy. The earliest of them can hardly be dated later than about
600 B.C., since some important doctrines first met with in them are
presupposed by Buddhism. They may be divided chronologically, on
internal evidence, into four classes. The oldest group, consisting, in
chronological order, of the <i>B&#7771;ihad&#257;ra&#7751;yaka</i>,
<i>Chh&#257;ndogya</i>, <i>Taittir&#299;ya</i>, <i>Aitareya</i>,
<i>Kaush&#299;taki</i>, is written in prose which still suffers from
the awkwardness of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a style. A transition is
formed by the <i>Kena</i>, which is partly in verse and partly in
prose, to a decidedly later class, the <i>K&#257;&#7789;haka</i>,
<i>&#298;&ccedil;&#257;</i>, <i>&Ccedil;vet&#257;&ccedil;vatara</i>,
<i>Mu&#7751;&#7693;aka</i>, <i>Mah&#257;n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</i>,
which are metrical, and in which the Upanishad doctrine is no longer
developing, but has become fixed. These are more attractive from the
literary point of view. Even those of the older class acquire a
peculiar charm from their liveliness, enthusiasm, and freedom from
pedantry, while their language often rises to the level of eloquence.
The third class, comprising the <i>Pra&ccedil;na</i>,
<i>Maitr&#257;ya&#7751;&#299;ya</i>, and
<i>M&#257;&#7751;&#7693;&#363;kya</i>, reverts to the use of prose,
which is, however, of a much less archaic type than that of the first
class, and approaches that of classical Sanskrit writers. The fourth
class consists of the later Atharvan Upanishads, some of which are
composed in prose, others in verse.</p>
<p>The <i>Aitareya</i>, one of the shortest of the Upanishads
(extending to only about four octavo pages), consists of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span>three chapters. The first represents the world
as a creation of the &#256;tman (also called Brahma), and man as its
highest manifestation. It is based on the Purusha hymn of the
<i>Rigveda</i>, but the primeval man is in the Upanishad described as
having been produced by the &#256;tman from the waters which it
created. The &#256;tman is here said to occupy three abodes in man, the
senses, mind, and heart, to which respectively correspond the three
conditions of waking, dreaming, and deep sleep. The second chapter
treats of the threefold birth of the &#256;tman. The end of
transmigration is salvation, which is represented as an immortal
existence in heaven. The last chapter dealing with the nature of the
&#256;tman states that &ldquo;consciousness (<i>prajn&#257;</i>) is
Brahma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Kaush&#299;taki Upanishad</i> is a treatise of considerable
length divided into four chapters. The first deals with the two paths
traversed by souls after death in connection with transmigration; the
second with <i>Pr&#257;&#7751;a</i> or life as a symbol of the
&#256;tman. The last two, while discussing the doctrine of Brahma,
contain a disquisition about the dependence of the objects of sense on
the organs of sense, and of the latter on unconscious life
(<i>pr&#257;&#7751;a</i>) and conscious life
(<i>prajn&#257;tm&#257;</i>). Those who aim at redeeming knowledge are
therefore admonished not to seek after objects or subjective faculties,
but only the subject of cognition and action, which is described with
much power as the highest god, and at the same time as the &#256;tman
within us.</p>
<p>The Upanishads of the <i>S&#257;maveda</i> start from the
<i>s&#257;man</i> or chant, just as those of the <i>Rigveda</i> from
the <i>uktha</i> or hymn recited by the <i>Hot&#7771;i</i> priest, in
order, by interpreting it allegorically, to arrive at a knowledge of
the &#256;tman or Brahma. The fact that the Upanishads <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name="pb228">228</a>]</span>have
the same basis, which is, moreover, largely treated in a similar
manner, leads to the conclusion that the various Vedic schools found a
common body of oral tradition which they shaped into dogmatic
texts-books or Upanishads in their own way.</p>
<p>Thus the <i>Chh&#257;ndogya</i>, which is equal in importance, and
only slightly inferior in extent, to the
<i>B&#7771;ihad&#257;ra&#7751;yaka</i>, bears clear traces, like the
latter, of being made up of collections of floating materials. Each of
its eight chapters forms an independent whole, followed by
supplementary pieces often but slightly connected with the main
subject-matter.</p>
<p>The first two chapters consist of mystical interpretations of the
<i>s&#257;man</i> and its chief part, called <i>Udg&#299;tha</i>
(&ldquo;loud song&rdquo;). A supplement to the second chapter treats,
among other subjects, of the origin of the syllable <i>om</i>, and of
the three stages of religious life, those of the Brahman pupil, the
householder, and the ascetic (to which later the religious mendicant
was added as a fourth). The third chapter in the main deals with Brahma
as the sun of the universe, the natural sun being its manifestation.
The infinite Brahma is further described as dwelling, whole and
undivided, in the heart of man. The way in which Brahma is to be
attained is then described, and the great fundamental dogma of the
identity of Brahma with the &#256;tman (or, as we might say, of God and
Soul) is declared. The chapter concludes with a myth which forms a
connecting link between the cosmogonic conceptions of the
<i>Rigveda</i> and those of the law-book of Manu. The fourth chapter,
containing discussions about wind, breath, and other phenomena
connected with Brahma, also teaches how the soul makes its way to
Brahma after death. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229"
name="pb229">229</a>]</span></p>
<p>The first half of chapter v. is almost identical with the beginning
of chapter vi. of the <i>B&#7771;ihad&#257;ra&#7751;yaka</i>. It is
chiefly noteworthy for the theory of transmigration which it contains.
The second half of the chapter is important as the earliest statement
of the doctrine that the manifold world is unreal. The <i>sat</i> by
desire produced from itself the three primary elements, heat, water,
food (the later number being five&mdash;ether, air, fire, water,
earth). As individual soul (<i>j&#299;va-&#257;tman</i>) it entered
into these, which, by certain partial combinations called
&ldquo;triplication,&rdquo; became various products
(<i>vik&#257;ra</i>) or phenomena. But the latter are a mere name.
<i>Sat</i> is the only reality, it is the &#256;tman: &ldquo;Thou art
that.&rdquo; Chapter vii. enumerates sixteen forms in which Brahma may
be adored, rising by gradation from <i>n&#257;man</i>,
&ldquo;name,&rdquo; to <i>bh&#363;man</i>, &ldquo;infinity,&rdquo;
which is the all-in-all and the &#256;tman within us. The first half of
the last chapter discusses the &#256;tman in the heart and the
universe, as well as how to attain it. The concluding portion of the
chapter distinguishes the false from the true &#256;tman, illustrated
by the three stages in which it appears&mdash;in the material body, in
dreaming, and in sound sleep. In the latter stage we have the true
&#256;tman, in which the distinction between subject and object has
disappeared.</p>
<p>To the <i>S&#257;maveda</i> also belongs a very short treatise which
was long called the <i>Talavak&#257;ra Upanishad</i>, from the school
to which it was attached, but later, when it became separated from that
school, received the name of <i>Kena</i>, from its initial word. It
consists of two distinct parts. The second, composed in prose and much
older, describes the relation of the Vedic gods to Brahma, representing
them as deriving their power from and entirely dependent on the latter.
The first part, which is metrical <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230"
href="#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>and belongs to the period of
fully developed Ved&#257;nta doctrine, distinguishes from the qualified
Brahma, which is an object of worship, the unqualified Brahma, which is
unknowable:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">To it no eye can penetrate,</p>
<p class="line">Nor speech nor thought can ever reach:</p>
<p class="line">It rests unknown; we cannot see</p>
<p class="line">How any one may teach it us.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The various Upanishads of the <i>Black Yajurveda</i>
all bear the stamp of lateness. The <i>Maitr&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> is a
prose work of considerable extent, in which occasional stanzas are
interspersed. It consists of seven chapters, the seventh and the
concluding eight sections of the sixth forming a supplement. The fact
that it retains the orthographical and euphonic peculiarities of the
Maitr&#257;ya&#7751;a school, gives this Upanishad an archaic
appearance. But its many quotations from other Upanishads, the
occurrence of several late words, the developed S&#257;nkhya doctrine
presupposed by it, distinct references to anti-Vedic heretical schools,
all combine to render the late character of this work undoubted. It is,
in fact, a summing up of the old Upanishad doctrines with an admixture
of ideas derived from the S&#257;nkhya system and from Buddhism. The
main body of the treatise expounds the nature of the &#256;tman,
communicated to King B&#7771;ihadratha of the race of Ikshv&#257;ku
(probably identical with the king of that name mentioned in the
<i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i>), who declaims at some length on the
misery and transitoriness of earthly existence. Though pessimism is not
unknown to the old Upanishads, it is much more pronounced here,
doubtless in consequence of S&#257;nkhya and Buddhistic influence.</p>
<p>The subject is treated in the form of three <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e7275" title="Source: ques tions">questions</span>. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name="pb231">231</a>]</span>The
answer to the first, how the &#256;tman enters the body, is that
Praj&#257;pati enters in the form of the five vital airs in order to
animate the lifeless bodies created by him. The second question is, How
does the supreme soul become the individual soul
(<i>bh&#363;t&#257;tman</i>)? This is answered rather in accordance
with the S&#257;nkhya than the Ved&#257;nta doctrine. Overcome by the
three qualities of matter (<i>prak&#7771;iti</i>), the &#256;tman,
forgetting its real nature, becomes involved in self-consciousness and
transmigration. The third question is, How is deliverance from this
state of misery possible? This is answered in conformity with neither
Ved&#257;nta nor S&#257;nkhya doctrine, but in a reactionary spirit.
Only those who observe the old requirements of Brahmanism, the rules of
caste and the religious orders (<i>&#257;&ccedil;ramas</i>), are
declared capable of attaining salvation by knowledge, penance, and
meditation on Brahma. The chief gods, that is to say, the triad of the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a period, Fire, Wind, Sun, the three abstractions,
Time, Breath, Food, and the three popular gods, Brahm&#257;, Rudra
(<i>i.e.</i> &Ccedil;iva), and Vish&#7751;u are explained as
manifestations of Brahma.</p>
<p>The remainder of this Upanishad is supplementary, but contains
several passages of considerable interest. We have here a cosmogonic
myth, like those of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as, in which the three
qualities of matter, <i>Tamas</i>, <i>Rajas</i>, <i>Sattva</i>, are
connected with Rudra, Brahm&#257;, and Vish&#7751;u, and which is in
other respects very remarkable as a connecting link between the
philosophy of the <i>Rigveda</i> and the later S&#257;nkhya system. The
sun is further represented as the external, and <i>pr&#257;&#7751;a</i>
(breath) as the internal, symbol of the &#256;tman, their worship being
recommended by means of the sacred syllable <i>om</i>, the three
&ldquo;utterances&rdquo; (<i>vy&#257;h&#7771;itis</i>)
<i>bh&#363;r</i>, <i>bhuvah&#803;</i>, <i>svar</i>, and the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span>famous <i>S&#257;vitr&#299;</i> stanza. As a
means of attaining Brahma we find a recommendation of <i>Yoga</i> or
the ascetic practices leading to a state of mental concentration and
bordering on trance. The information we here receive of these practices
is still undeveloped compared with the later system. In addition to the
three conditions of Brahma, waking, dreaming, and deep sleep, mention
is made of a fourth (<i>tur&#299;ya</i>) and highest stage. The
Upanishad concludes with the declaration that the &#256;tman entered
the world of duality because it wished to taste both truth and
illusion.</p>
<p>Older than the <i>Maitr&#257;ya&#7751;a</i>, which borrows from
them, are two other Upanishads of the <i>Black Yajurveda</i>, the
<i>K&#257;&#7789;haka</i> and the
<i>&Ccedil;vet&#257;&ccedil;vatara</i>. The former contains some 120
and the latter some 110 stanzas.</p>
<p>The <i>K&#257;&#7789;haka</i> deals with the legend of Nachiketas,
which is told in the K&#257;&#7789;haka portion of the
<i>Taittir&#299;ya Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>, and a knowledge of which it
presupposes. This is indicated by the fact that it begins with the same
words as the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a story. The treatise appears to have
consisted originally of the first only of its two chapters. For the
second, with its more developed notions about <i>Yoga</i> and its much
more pronounced view as to the unreality of phenomena, looks like a
later addition. The first contains an introductory narrative, an
account of the &#256;tman, of its embodiment and final return by means
of <i>Yoga</i>. The second chapter, though less well arranged, on the
whole corresponds in matter with the first. Its fourth section, while
discussing the nature of the &#256;tman, identifies both soul
(<i>purusha</i>) and matter (<i>prak&#7771;iti</i>) with it. The fifth
section deals with the manifestation of the &#256;tman in the world,
and especially in man. The way in which it at <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name="pb233">233</a>]</span>the
same time remains outside them in its full integrity and is not
affected by the suffering of living beings, is strikingly illustrated
by the analogy of both light and air, which pervade space and yet
embrace every object, and of the sun, the eye of the universe, which
remains free from the blemishes of all other eyes outside of it. In the
last section <i>Yoga</i> is taught to be the means of attaining the
highest goal. The gradation of mental faculties here described is of
great interest for the history of the S&#257;nkhya and Yoga system. An
unconscious contradiction runs through this discussion, inasmuch as
though the &#256;tman is regarded as the all-in-all, a sharp contrast
is drawn between soul and matter. It is the contradiction between the
later Ved&#257;nta and the S&#257;nkhya-Yoga systems of <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e7378" title="Source: philosphy">philosophy</span>.</p>
<p>According to its own statement, the
<i>&Ccedil;vet&#257;&ccedil;vatara Upanishad</i> derives its name from
an individual author, and the tradition which attributes it to one of
the schools of the <i>Black Yajurveda</i> hardly seems to have a
sufficient foundation. Its confused arrangement, the irregularities and
arbitrary changes of its metres, the number of interpolated quotations
which it contains, make the assumption likely that the work in its
present form is not the work of a single author. In its present form it
is certainly later than the <i>K&#257;&#7789;haka</i>, since it
contains several passages which must be referred to that work, besides
many stanzas borrowed from it with or without variation. Its lateness
is further indicated by the developed theory of <i>Yoga</i> which it
contains, besides the more or less definite form in which it exhibits
various Ved&#257;nta doctrines either unknown to or only foreshadowed
in the earlier Upanishads. Among these may be mentioned the destruction
of the world <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span>by Brahma at the end of a cosmic age
(<i>kalpa</i>), as well as its periodic renewal out of Brahma, and
especially the explanation of the world as an illusion
(<i>m&#257;y&#257;</i>) produced by Brahma. At the same time the author
shows a strange predilection for the personified forms of Brahma as
Savit&#7771;i, &#298;&ccedil;&#257;na, or Rudra. Though &Ccedil;iva has
not yet become the name of Rudra, its frequent use as an adjective
connected with the latter shows that it is in course of becoming fixed
as the proper name of the highest god. In this Upanishad we meet with a
number of the terms and fundamental notions of the S&#257;nkhya, though
the point of view is thoroughly Ved&#257;ntist; matter
(<i>prak&#7771;iti</i>), for instance, being represented as an illusion
produced by Brahma.</p>
<p>To the <i>White Yajurveda</i> is attached the longest, and, beside
the <i>Chh&#257;ndogya</i>, the most important of the Upanishads. It
bears even clearer traces than that work of being a conglomerate of
what must originally have been separate treatises. It is divided into
three parts, each containing two chapters. The last part is designated,
even in the tradition of the commentaries, as a supplement
(<i>Khila-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</i>), a statement fully borne out by
the contents. That the first and second parts were also originally
independent of each other is sufficiently proved by both containing the
legend of Y&#257;jnavalkya and his two wives in almost identical words
throughout. To each of these parts (as well as to Book x. of the
<i>&Ccedil;atapatha Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>) a successive list
(<i>vam&#803;&ccedil;a</i>) of teachers is attached. A comparison of
these lists seems to justify the conclusion that the first part (called
<i>Madhuk&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</i>) and the second
(<i>Y&#257;jnavalkya-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</i>) existed during nine
generations as independent Upanishads within the school of the <i>White
Yajurveda</i>, and were then combined by a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name=
"pb235">235</a>]</span>teacher named &#256;gnive&ccedil;ya; the third
part, which consists of all kinds of supplementary matter, being
subsequently added. These lists further make the conclusion probable
that the leading teachers of the ritual tradition
(Br&#257;hma&#7751;as) were different from those of the philosophical
tradition (Upanishads).</p>
<p>Beginning with an allegorical interpretation of the most important
sacrifice, the <i>A&ccedil;vamedha</i> (horse-sacrifice), as the
universe, the first chapter proceeds to deal with
<i>pr&#257;&#7751;a</i> (breath) as a symbol of soul, and then with the
creation of the world out of the &#256;tman or Brahma, insisting on the
dependence of all existence on the Supreme Soul, which appears in every
individual as his self. The polemical attitude adopted against the
worship of the gods is characteristic, showing that the passage belongs
to an early period, in which the doctrine of the superiority of the
&#256;tman to the gods was still asserting itself. The next chapter
deals with the nature of the &#256;tman and its manifestations,
<i>purusha</i> and <i>pr&#257;&#7751;a</i>.</p>
<p>The second part of the Upanishad consists of four philosophical
discussions, in which Y&#257;jnavalkya is the chief speaker. The first
(iii. 1&ndash;9) is a great disputation, in which the sage proves his
superiority to nine successive interlocutors. One of the most
interesting conclusions here arrived at is that Brahma is theoretically
unknowable, but can be comprehended practically. The second discourse
is a dialogue between King Janaka and Y&#257;jnavalkya, in which the
latter shows the untenableness of six definitions set up by other
teachers as to the nature of Brahma; for instance, that it is identical
with Breath or Mind. He finally declares that the &#256;tman can only
be described negatively, being intangible, indestructible, independent,
immovable. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236</a>]</span></p>
<p>The third discourse (iv. 3&ndash;4) is another dialogue between
Janaka and Y&#257;jnavalkya. It presents a picture of the soul in the
conditions of waking, dreaming, deep sleep, dying, transmigration, and
salvation. For wealth of illustration, fervour of conviction, beauty
and elevation of thought, this piece is unequalled in the Upanishads or
any other work of Indian literature. Its literary effect is heightened
by the numerous stanzas with which it is interspersed. These are,
however, doubtless later additions. The dreaming soul is thus
described:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Leaving its lower nest in breath&rsquo;s
protection,</p>
<p class="line">And upward from that nest, immortal, soaring,</p>
<p class="line">Where&rsquo;er it lists it roves about immortal,</p>
<p class="line">The golden-pinioned only swan of spirit <span class=
"rm">(IV. iii. 13).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">It roves in dream condition up and downward,</p>
<p class="line">Divinely many shapes and forms assuming <span class=
"rm">(ib. 14).</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">Then follows an account of the dreamless state of the
soul:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first"><i>As a falcon or an eagle, having flown about in the
air, exhausted folds together its wings and prepares to alight, so the
spirit hastes to that condition in which, asleep, it feels no desire
and sees no dream</i> (19).</p>
<p><i>This is its essential form, in which it rises above desire, is
free from evil and without fear. For as one embraced by a beloved woman
wots not of anything without or within, so also the soul embraced by
the cognitional Self wots not of anything without or within</i>
(21).</p>
</div>
<p>With regard to the souls of those who are not saved, the view of the
writer appears to be that after death they enter a new body immediately
and without any intervening retribution in the other world, in exact
accordance with their intellectual and moral quality. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first"><i>As a caterpillar, when it has reached the point of
a leaf, makes a new beginning and draws itself across, so the soul,
after casting off the body and letting go ignorance, makes a new
beginning and draws itself across</i> (IV. iv. 3).</p>
<p><i>As a goldsmith takes the material of an image and hammers out of
it another newer and more beautiful form, so also the soul after
casting off the body and letting go ignorance, creates for itself
another newer and more beautiful form, either that of the Fathers or
the Gandharvas or the Gods, or Praj&#257;pati or Brahma, or other
beings</i> (IV. iv. 4).</p>
</div>
<p>But the vital airs of him who is saved, who knows himself to be
identical with Brahma, do not depart, for he is absorbed in Brahma and
is Brahma.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first"><i>As a serpent&rsquo;s skin, dead and cast off, lies
upon an ant-hill, so his body then lies; but that which is bodiless and

</div>
<p>The fourth discourse is a dialogue between Y&#257;jnavalkya and his
wife Maitrey&#299;, before the former, about to renounce the world,
retires to the solitude of the forest. There are several indications
that it is a secondary recension of the same conversation occurring in
a previous chapter (II. iv.).</p>
<p>The first chapter of the third or supplementary part consists of
fifteen sections, which are often quite short, are mostly unconnected
in matter, and appear to be of very different age. The second chapter,
however, forms a long and important treatise (identical with that found
in the <i>Chh&#257;ndogya</i>) on the doctrine of transmigration. The
views here expressed are so much at variance with those of
Y&#257;jnavalkya that this text must have originated in another Vedic
school, and have been loosely attached to this Upanishad owing to the
peculiar importance of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href=
"#pb238" name="pb238">238</a>]</span>its contents. The preceding and
following section, which are connected with it, and are also found in
the <i>Chh&#257;ndogya</i>, must have been added at the same time.</p>
<p>Not only is the longest Upanishad attached to the <i>White
Yajurveda</i>, but also one of the very shortest, consisting of only
eighteen stanzas. This is the <i>&#298;&ccedil;&#257;</i>, which is so
called from its initial word. Though forming the last chapter of the
<i>V&#257;jasaneyi Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i>, it belongs to a rather late
period. It is about contemporaneous with the latest parts of the
<i>B&#7771;ihad&#257;ra&#7751;yaka</i>, is more developed in many
points than the <i>K&#257;&#7789;haka</i>, but seems to be older than
the <i>&Ccedil;vet&#257;&ccedil;vatara</i>. Its leading motive is to
contrast him who knows himself to be the same as the &#256;tman with
him who does not possess true knowledge. It affords an excellent survey
of the fundamental doctrines of the Ved&#257;nta philosophy.</p>
<p>A large and indefinite number of Upanishads is attributed to the
<i>Atharva-veda</i>, but the most authoritative list recognises
twenty-seven altogether. They are for the most part of very late
origin, being post-Vedic, and, all but three, contemporaneous with the
Pur&#257;&#7751;as. One of them is actually a Muhammadan treatise
entitled the <i>Alla Upanishad</i>! The older Upanishads which belong
to the first three Vedas were, with a few exceptions like the
<i>&Ccedil;vet&#257;&ccedil;vatara</i>, the dogmatic text-books of
actual Vedic schools, and received their names from those schools,
being connected with and supplementary to the ritual
Br&#257;hma&#7751;as. The Upanishads of the <i>Atharva-veda</i>, on the
other hand, are with few exceptions like the
<i>M&#257;&#7751;&#7693;&#363;kya</i> and the <i>J&#257;b&#257;la</i>,
no longer connected with Vedic schools, but derive their names from
their subject-matter or some other circumstance. They appear for the
most part to represent the views of theosophic, mystic, ascetic,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=
"pb239">239</a>]</span>or sectarian associations, who wished to have an
Upanishad of their own in imitation of the old Vedic schools. They
became attached to the <i>Atharva-veda</i> not from any internal
connection, but partly because the followers of the <i>Atharva-veda</i>
desired to become possessed of dogmatic text-books of their own, and
partly because the fourth Veda was not protected from the intrusion of
foreign elements by the watchfulness of religious guilds like the old
Vedic schools.</p>
<p>The fundamental doctrine common to all the Upanishads of the
<i>Atharva-veda</i> is developed by most of them in various special
directions. They may accordingly be divided into four categories which
run chronologically parallel with one another, each containing
relatively old and late productions. The first group, as directly
investigating the nature of the &#256;tman, has a scope similar to that
of the Upanishads of the other Vedas, and goes no further than the
latter in developing its main thesis. The next group, taking the
fundamental doctrine for granted, treats of absorption in the
&#256;tman through ascetic meditation (<i>yoga</i>) based on the
component parts of the sacred syllable <i>om</i>. These Upanishads are
almost without exception composed in verse and are quite short,
consisting on the average of about twenty stanzas. In the third
category the life of the religious mendicant (<i>sanny&#257;sin</i>),
as a practical consequence of the Upanishad doctrine, is recommended
and described. These Upanishads, too, are short, but are written in
prose, though with an admixture of verse. The last group is sectarian
in character, interpreting the popular gods &Ccedil;iva (under various
names, such as &#298;&ccedil;&#257;na, Mahe&ccedil;vara, Mah&#257;deva)
and Vish&#7751;u (as N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a and N&#7771;isim&#803;ha
or &ldquo;Man-lion&rdquo;) as personifications <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name="pb240">240</a>]</span>of
the &#256;tman. The different Avat&#257;rs of Vish&#7751;u are here
regarded as human manifestations of the &#256;tman.</p>
<p>The oldest and most important of these Atharvan Upanishads, as
representing the Ved&#257;nta doctrine most faithfully, are the
<i>Mu&#7751;&#7693;aka</i>, the <i>Pra&ccedil;na</i>, and to a less
degree the <i>M&#257;&#7751;&#7693;&#363;kya</i>. The first two come
nearest to the Upanishads of the older Vedas, and are much quoted by
B&#257;dar&#257;ya&#7751;a and &Ccedil;ankara, the great authorities of
the later Ved&#257;nta philosophy. They are the only original and
legitimate Upanishads of the <i>Atharva</i>. The
<i>Mu&#7751;&#7693;aka</i> derives its name from being the Upanishad of
the tonsured (<i>mu&#7751;&#7693;a</i>), an association of ascetics who
shaved their heads, as the Buddhist monks did later. It is one of the
most popular of the Upanishads, not owing to the originality of its
contents, which are for the most part derived from older texts, but
owing to the purity with which it reproduces the old Ved&#257;nta
doctrine, and the beauty of the stanzas in which it is composed. It
presupposes, above all, the <i>Chh&#257;ndogya Upanishad</i>, and in
all probability the <i>B&#7771;ihad&#257;ra&#7751;yaka</i>, the
<i>Taittir&#299;ya</i>, and the <i>K&#257;&#7789;haka</i>. Having
several important passages in common with the
<i>&Ccedil;vet&#257;&ccedil;vatara</i> and the
<i>B&#7771;ihann&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> of the <i>Black
Yajurveda</i>, it probably belongs to the same epoch, coming between
the two in order of time. It consists of three parts, which, speaking
generally, deal respectively with the preparations for the knowledge of
Brahma, the doctrine of Brahma, and the way to Brahma.</p>
<p>The <i>Pra&ccedil;na Upanishad</i>, written in prose and apparently
belonging to the Pippal&#257;da recension of the <i>Atharva-veda</i>,
is so called because it treats, in the form of questions
(<i>pra&ccedil;na</i>) addressed by six students of Brahma to the sage
<span class="sc">Pippal&#257;da</span>, six main points of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>Ved&#257;nta doctrine. These questions concern
the origin of matter and life (<i>pr&#257;&#7751;a</i>) from
Praj&#257;pati; the superiority of life (<i>pr&#257;&#7751;a</i>) above
the other vital powers; the nature and divisions of the vital powers;
dreaming and dreamless sleep; meditation on the syllable <i>om</i>; and
the sixteen parts of man.</p>
<p>The <i>M&#257;&#7751;&#7693;&#363;kya</i> is a very short prose
Upanishad, which would hardly fill two pages of the present book.
Though bearing the name of a half-forgotten school of the
<i>Rigveda</i>, it is reckoned among the Upanishads of the
<i>Atharva-veda</i>. It must date from a considerably later time than
the prose Upanishads of the three older Vedas, with the unmethodical
treatment and prolixity of which its precision and conciseness are in
marked contrast. It has many points of contact with the
<i>Maitr&#257;ya&#7751;a Upanishad</i>, to which it seems to be
posterior. It appears, however, to be older than the rest of the
treatises which form the fourth class of the Upanishads of the
<i>Atharva-veda</i>. Thus it distinguishes only three <i>morae</i> in
the syllable <i>om</i>, and not yet three and a half. The fundamental
idea of this Upanishad is that the sacred syllable is an expression of
the universe. It is somewhat remarkable that this work is not quoted by
&Ccedil;ankara; nevertheless, it not only exercised a great influence
on several Upanishads of the <i>Atharva-veda</i>, but was used more
than any other Upanishad by the author of the well-known later epitome
of the Ved&#257;nta doctrine, the <i>Ved&#257;nta-s&#257;ra</i>.</p>
<p>It is, however, chiefly important as having given rise to one of the
most remarkable products of Indian philosophy, the
<i>K&#257;rik&#257;</i> of <span class=
"sc">Gau&#7693;ap&#257;da</span>. This work consists of more than 200
stanzas divided into four parts, the first of which includes the
<i>M&#257;&#7751;&#7693;&#363;kya Upanishad</i>. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name="pb242">242</a>]</span>The
esteem in which the <i>K&#257;rik&#257;</i> was held is indicated by
the fact that its parts are reckoned as four Upanishads. There is much
probability in the assumption that its author is identical with
Gau&#7693;ap&#257;da, the teacher of Govinda, whose pupil was the great
Ved&#257;ntist commentator, <span class="sc">&Ccedil;ankara</span> (800
A.D.). The point of view of the latter is the same essentially as that
of the author of the <i>K&#257;rik&#257;</i>, and many of the thoughts
and figures which begin to appear in the earlier work are in common use
in &Ccedil;ankara&rsquo;s commentaries. &Ccedil;ankara may, in fact, be
said to have reduced the doctrines of Gau&#7693;ap&#257;da to a system,
as did Plato those of Parmenides. Indeed, the two leading ideas which
pervade the Indian poem, viz., that there is no duality
(<i>advaita</i>) and no becoming (<i>aj&#257;ti</i>), are, as Professor
Deussen points out, identical with those of the Greek philosopher.</p>
<p>The first part of the <i>K&#257;rik&#257;</i> is practically a
metrical paraphrase of the <i>M&#257;&#7751;&#7693;&#363;kya
Upanishad</i>. Peculiar to it is the statement that the world is not an
illusion or a development in any sense, but the very nature or essence
(<i>svabh&#257;va</i>) of Brahma, just as the rays, which are all the
same (<i>i.e.</i> light), are not different from the sun. The remainder
of the poem is independent of the Upanishad and goes far beyond its
doctrines. The second part has the special title of <i>Vaitathya</i> or
the &ldquo;Falseness&rdquo; of the doctrine of reality. Just as a rope
is in the dark mistaken for a snake, so the &#256;tman in the darkness
of ignorance is mistaken for the world. Every attempt to imagine the
&#256;tman under empirical forms is futile, for every one&rsquo;s idea
of it is dependent on his experience of the world.</p>
<p>The third part is entitled <i>Advaita</i>,
&ldquo;Non-duality.&rdquo; The identity of the Supreme Soul
(<i>&#256;tman</i>) with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href=
"#pb243" name="pb243">243</a>]</span>individual soul (<i>j&#299;va</i>)
is illustrated by comparison with space, and that part of it which is
contained in a jar. Arguing against the theory of genesis and
plurality, the poet lays down the axiom that nothing can become
different from its own nature. The production of the existent (<i>sato
janma</i>) is impossible, for that would be produced which already
exists. The production of the non-existent (<i>asato janma</i>) is also
impossible, for the non-existent is never produced, any more than the
son of a barren woman. The last part is entitled
<i>Al&#257;ta-&ccedil;&#257;nti</i>, or &ldquo;Extinction of the
firebrand (circle),&rdquo; so called from an ingenious comparison made
to explain how plurality and genesis seem to exist in the world. If a
stick which is glowing at one end is waved about, fiery lines or
circles are produced without anything being added to or issuing from
the single burning point. The fiery line or circle exists only in the
consciousness (<i>vijn&#257;na</i>). So, too, the many phenomena of the
world are merely the vibrations of the consciousness, which is one.

<h2 class="main">The S&#363;tras</h2>
<h2 class="sub">(<i>Circa</i> 500&ndash;200 B.C.)</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As the Upanishads were a development of the
speculative side of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as and constituted the
textbooks of Vedic dogma, so the &Ccedil;rauta S&#363;tras form the
continuation of their ritual side, though they are not, like the
Upanishads, regarded as a part of revelation. A sacred character was
never attributed to them, probably because they were felt to be
treatises compiled, with the help of oral priestly tradition, from the
contents of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as solely to meet practical needs.
The oldest of them seem to go back to about the time when Buddhism came
into being. Indeed it is quite possible that the rise of the rival
religion gave the first impetus to the composition of systematic
manuals of Brahmanic worship. The Buddhists in their turn must have
come to regard S&#363;tras as the type of treatise best adapted for the
expression of religious doctrine, for the earliest P&#257;li texts are
works of this character. The term Kalpa S&#363;tra is used to designate
the whole body of S&#363;tras concerned with religion which belonged to
a particular Vedic school. Where such a complete collection has been
preserved, the &Ccedil;rauta S&#363;tra forms its first and most
extensive portion.</p>
<p>To the <i>Rigveda</i> belong the &Ccedil;rauta manuals of two
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span>S&#363;tra schools (<i>chara&#7751;as</i>), the
&Ccedil;&#257;nkh&#257;yanas and the &#256;&ccedil;val&#257;yanas, the
former of whom were in later times settled in Northern Gujarat, the
latter in the South between the God&#257;var&#299; and the
K&#7771;ish&#7751;&#257;. The ritual is described in much the same
order by both, but the account of the great royal sacrifices is much
more detailed in the <i>&Ccedil;&#257;nkh&#257;yana &Ccedil;rauta
S&#363;tra</i>. The latter, which is closely connected with the
<i>&Ccedil;&#257;nkh&#257;yana Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>, seems to be the
older of the two, on the ground both of its matter and of its style,
which in many parts resembles that of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as. It
consists of eighteen books, the last two of which were added later, and
correspond to the first two books of the <i>Kaush&#299;taki
&#256;ra&#7751;yaka</i>. The &Ccedil;rauta S&#363;tra of <span class=
"sc">&#256;&ccedil;val&#257;yana</span>, which consists of twelve
books, is related to the <i>Aitareya Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>.
&#256;&ccedil;val&#257;yana is also known as the author of the fourth
book of the <i>Aitareya &#256;ra&#7751;yaka</i>, and was according to
tradition the pupil of &Ccedil;aunaka.</p>
<p>Three &Ccedil;rauta S&#363;tras to the <i>S&#257;maveda</i> have
been preserved. The oldest, that of <span class=
"sc">Ma&ccedil;aka</span>, also called <i>&#256;rsheya-kalpa</i>, is
nothing more than an enumeration of the prayers belonging to the
various ceremonies of the Soma sacrifice in the order of the
<i>Panchavim&#803;&ccedil;a Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>. The &Ccedil;rauta
S&#363;tra composed by <span class=
"sc">L&#257;&#7789;y&#257;yana</span>, became the accepted manual of
the Kauthuma school. This S&#363;tra, like that of Ma&ccedil;aka, which
it quotes, is closely connected with the <i>Panchavim&#803;&ccedil;a
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>. The &Ccedil;rauta S&#363;tra of <span class=
"sc">Dr&#257;hy&#257;ya&#7751;a</span>, which differs but little from
that of L&#257;&#7789;y&#257;yana, belongs to the
R&#257;&#7751;&#257;yan&#299;ya branch of the <i>S&#257;maveda</i>.</p>
<p>To the <i>White Yajurveda</i> belongs the &Ccedil;rauta S&#363;tra
of <span class="sc">K&#257;ty&#257;yana</span>. This manual, which
consists of twenty-six chapters, on the whole strictly follows the
sacrificial <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>order of the <i>&Ccedil;atapatha
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>. Three of its chapters (xxii.&ndash;xxiv.),
however, relate to the ceremonial of the <i>S&#257;maveda</i>. Owing to
the enigmatical character of its style, it appears to be one of the
later productions of the S&#363;tra period.</p>
<p>No less than six &Ccedil;rauta S&#363;tras belonging to the <i>Black
Yajurveda</i> have been preserved, but only two of them have as yet
been published. Four of these form a very closely connected group,
being part of the Kalpa S&#363;tras of four subdivisions of the
Taittir&#299;ya &Ccedil;&#257;kh&#257;, which represented the later
s&#363;tra schools (<i>chara&#7751;as</i>) not claiming a special
revelation of Veda or Br&#257;hma&#7751;a. The &Ccedil;rauta S&#363;tra
of <span class="sc">&#256;pastamba</span> forms the first twenty-four
of the thirty chapters (<i>pra&ccedil;nas</i>) into which his Kalpa
S&#363;tra is divided; and that of <span class=
"sc">Hira&#7751;yake&ccedil;in</span>, an offshoot of the
&#256;pastambas, the first eighteen of the twenty-nine chapters of his
Kalpa S&#363;tra. The S&#363;tra of <span class=
"sc">Baudh&#257;yana</span>, who is older than &#256;pastamba, as well
as that of <span class="sc">Bh&#257;radv&#257;ja</span>, has not yet
been published.</p>
<p>Connected with the <i>Maitr&#257;ya&#7751;&#299;
Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i> is the <i>M&#257;nava &Ccedil;rauta
S&#363;tra</i>. It belongs to the M&#257;navas, who were a subdivision
of the Maitr&#257;ya&#7751;&#299;yas, and to whom the law-book of Manu
probably traces its origin. It seems to be one of the oldest. It has a
descriptive character, resembling the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a parts of the
<i>Yajurveda</i>, and differing from them only in simply describing the
course of the sacrifice, to the exclusion of legends, speculations, or
discussions of any kind. There is also a <i>Vaikh&#257;nasa
&Ccedil;rauta S&#363;tra</i> attached to the <i>Black Yajurveda</i>,
but it is known only in a few MSS.</p>
<p>The &Ccedil;rauta S&#363;tra of the <i>Atharva-veda</i> is the
<i>Vait&#257;na S&#363;tra</i>. It is neither old nor original, but was
undoubtedly compiled in order to supply the <i>Atharva</i>, like
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name=
"pb247">247</a>]</span>the other Vedas, with a S&#363;tra of its own.
It probably received its name from the word with which it begins, since
the term <i>vait&#257;na</i> (&ldquo;relating to the three sacrificial
fires&rdquo;) is equally applicable to all &Ccedil;rauta S&#363;tras.
It agrees to a considerable extent with the <i>Gopatha
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>, though it distinctly follows the S&#363;tra of
K&#257;ty&#257;yana to the <i>White Yajurveda</i>. One indication of
its lateness is the fact that whereas in other cases a G&#7771;ihya
regularly presupposes the &Ccedil;rauta S&#363;tra, the
<i>Vait&#257;na</i> is dependent on the domestic s&#363;tra of the
<i>Atharva-veda</i>.</p>
<p>Though the &Ccedil;rauta S&#363;tras are indispensable for the right
understanding of the sacrificial ritual, they are, from any other point
of view, a most unattractive form of literature. It will, therefore,
suffice to mention in briefest outline the ceremonies with which they
deal. It is important to remember, in the first place, that these rites
are never congregational, but are always performed on behalf of a
single individual, the so-called <i>Yajam&#257;na</i> or sacrificer,
who takes but little part in them. The officiators are Brahman priests,
whose number varies from one to sixteen, according to the nature of the
ceremony. In all these rites an important part is played by the three
sacred fires which surround the <i>vedi</i>, a slightly excavated spot
covered with a litter of grass for the reception of offerings to the
gods. The first ceremony of all is the setting up of the sacred fires
(<i>agni-&#257;dheya</i>), which are kindled by the sacrificer and his
wife with the firesticks, and are thereafter to be regularly
maintained.</p>
<p>The &Ccedil;rauta rites, fourteen in number, are divided into the
two main groups of seven oblation (<i>havis</i>) sacrifices and seven
soma sacrifices. Different forms of the animal sacrifice are classed
with each group. The <i>havis</i> sacrifices consist of offerings of
milk, ghee, porridge, grain, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href=
"#pb248" name="pb248">248</a>]</span>cakes, and so forth. The commonest
is the <i>Agnihotra</i>, the daily morning and evening oblation of milk
to the three fires. The most important of the others are the new and
full moon sacrifices (<i>dar&ccedil;ap&#363;r&#7751;a-m&#257;sa</i>)
and those offered at the beginning of the three seasons
(<i>ch&#257;turm&#257;sya</i>). Besides some other recurrent
sacrifices, there are very many which are to be offered on some
particular occasion, or for the attainment of some special object.</p>
<p>The various kinds of Soma sacrifices were much more complicated.
Even the simplest and fundamental form, the <i>Agnish&#7789;oma</i>
(&ldquo;praise of Agni&rdquo;) required the ministrations of sixteen
priests. This rite occupied only one day, with three pressings of soma,
at morning, noon, and evening; but this day was preceded by very
detailed preparatory ceremonies, one of which was the initiation
(<i>d&#299;ksh&#257;</i>) of the sacrificer and his wife. Other soma
sacrifices lasted for several days up to twelve; while another class,
called <i>sattra</i>s or &ldquo;sessions,&rdquo; extended to a year or
more.</p>
<p>A very sacred ceremony that can be connected with the soma sacrifice
is the <i>Agnichayana</i>, or &ldquo;Piling of the fire-altar,&rdquo;
which lasts for a year. It begins with a sacrifice of five animals.
Then a long time is occupied in preparing the earthenware vessel,
called <i>ukh&#257;</i>, in which fire is to be maintained for a year.
Very elaborate rules are given both as to the ingredients, such as the
hair of a black antelope, with which the clay is to be mixed, and as to
how it is to be shaped, and finally burnt. Then the bricks, which have
different and particular sizes, have to be built up in prescribed
order. The lowest of the five strata must have 1950, all of them
together, a total of 10,800 bricks. Many of these have their special
name <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name=
"pb249">249</a>]</span>and significance. Thus the altar is gradually
built up, as its bricks are placed in position, to the accompaniment of
appropriate rites and verses, by a formidable array of priests. These
are but some of the main points in the ceremony; but they will probably
give some faint idea of the enormous complexity and the vast mass of
detail, where the smallest of minuti&aelig; are of importance, in the
Brahman ritual. No other religion has ever known its like.</p>
<p>As the domestic ritual is almost entirely excluded from the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;as, the authors of the G&#7771;ihya S&#363;tras had
only the authority of popular tradition to rely on when they
systematised the observances of daily life. As a type, the G&#7771;ihya
manuals must be somewhat later than the &Ccedil;rauta, for they
regularly presuppose a knowledge of the latter.</p>
<p>To the <i>Rigveda</i> belongs in the first place the
<i>&Ccedil;&#257;nkh&#257;yana G&#7771;ihya S&#363;tra</i>. It consists
of six books, but only the first four form the original portion of the
work, and even these contain interpolations. Closely connected with
this work is the <i>&Ccedil;&#257;mbavya G&#7771;ihya</i>, which also
belongs to the school of the Kaush&#299;takins, and is as yet known
only in manuscript. Though borrowing largely from
&Ccedil;&#257;nkh&#257;yana, it is not identical with that work. It
knows nothing of the last two books, nor even a number of ceremonies
described in the third and fourth, while having a book of its own
concerning the sacrifice to the Manes. Connected with the <i>Aitareya
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i> is the G&#7771;ihya S&#363;tra of
&#256;&ccedil;val&#257;yana, which its author in the first aphorism
gives us to understand is a continuation of his &Ccedil;rauta
S&#363;tra. It consists of four books, and, like the latter work, ends
with the words &ldquo;adoration to &Ccedil;aunaka.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name="pb250">250</a>]</span></p>
<p>The chief G&#7771;ihya S&#363;tra of the <i>S&#257;maveda</i> is
that of <span class="sc">Gobhila</span>, which is one of the oldest,
completest, and most interesting works of this class. Its seems to have
been used by both the schools of its Veda. Besides the text of the
<i>S&#257;maveda</i> it presupposes the <i>Mantra
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>. The latter is a collection, in the ritual
order, of the <i>mantras</i> (except those occurring in the
<i>S&#257;maveda</i> itself), which are quoted by Gobhila in an
abbreviated form. The G&#7771;ihya S&#363;tra of <span class=
"sc">Kh&#257;dira</span>, belonging to the Dr&#257;hy&#257;ya&#7751;a
school and used by the R&#257;&#7751;&#257;yan&#299;ya branch of the
<i>S&#257;maveda</i>, is little more than Gobhila remodelled in a more
succinct form.</p>
<p>The G&#7771;ihya S&#363;tra of the <i>White Yajurveda</i> is that of
<span class="sc">P&#257;raskara</span>, also called the
<i>K&#257;t&#299;ya</i> or <i>V&#257;jasaneya G&#7771;ihya
S&#363;tra</i>. It is so closely connected with the &Ccedil;rauta
S&#363;tra of K&#257;ty&#257;yana, that it is often quoted under the
name of that author. The later law-book of Y&#257;jnavalkya bears
evidence of the influence of P&#257;raskara&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Of the seven G&#7771;ihya S&#363;tras of the <i>Black Yajurveda</i>
only three have as yet been published. The G&#7771;ihya of
&#256;pastamba forms two books (26&ndash;27) of his Kalpa S&#363;tra.
The first of these two books is the <i>Mantrap&#257;&#7789;ha</i>,
which is a collection of the formulas accompanying the ceremonies. The
G&#7771;ihya S&#363;tra, in the strict sense, is the second book, which
presupposes the <i>Mantrap&#257;&#7789;ha</i>. Books XIX. and XX. of
Hira&#7751;yake&ccedil;in&rsquo;s Kalpa S&#363;tra form his
G&#7771;ihya S&#363;tra. About Baudh&#257;yana&rsquo;s G&#7771;ihya not
much is known, still less about that of Bh&#257;radv&#257;ja. The
<i>M&#257;nava G&#7771;ihya S&#363;tra</i> is closely connected with
the &Ccedil;rauta, repeating many of the statements of the latter
verbally. It is interesting as containing a ceremony unknown to other
G&#7771;ihya S&#363;tras, the worship <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb251" href="#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span>of the
Vin&#257;yakas. The passage reappears in a versified form in
Y&#257;jnavalkya&rsquo;s law-book, where the four Vin&#257;yakas are
transformed into the one Vin&#257;yaka, the god Ga&#7751;e&ccedil;a.
With the <i>M&#257;nava</i> is clearly connected the
<i>K&#257;&#7789;haka G&#7771;ihya S&#363;tra</i>, not only in the
principle of its arrangement, but even in the wording of many passages.
It is nearly related to the law-book of Vish&#7751;u. The
<i>Vaikh&#257;nasa G&#7771;ihya S&#363;tra</i> is an extensive work
bearing traces of a late origin, and partly treating of subjects
otherwise relegated to works of a supplementary character.</p>
<p>To the <i>Atharva-veda</i> belongs the important <i>Kau&ccedil;ika
S&#363;tra</i>. It is not a mere G&#7771;ihya S&#363;tra, for besides
giving the more important rules of the domestic ritual, it deals with
the magical and other practices specially connected with its Veda. By
its extensive references to these subjects it supplies much material
unknown to other Vedic schools. It is a composite work, apparently made
up of four or five different treatises. In combination with the
<i>Atharva-veda</i> it supplies an almost complete picture of the
ordinary life of the Vedic Indian.</p>
<p>The G&#7771;ihya S&#363;tras give the rules for the numerous
ceremonies applicable to the domestic life of a man and his family from
birth to the grave. For the performance of their ritual only the
domestic (<i>&#257;vasathya</i> or <i>vaiv&#257;hika</i>) fire was
required, as contrasted with the three sacrificial fires of the
&Ccedil;rauta S&#363;tras. They describe forty consecrations or
sacraments (<i>sam&#803;sk&#257;ras</i>) which are performed at various
important epochs in the life of the individual. The first eighteen,
extending from conception to marriage, are called &ldquo;bodily
sacraments.&rdquo; The remaining twenty-two are sacrifices. Eight
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span>of these, the five daily sacrifices
(<i>mah&#257;yajna</i>) and some other &ldquo;baked offerings&rdquo;
(p&#257;kayajna), form part of the G&#7771;ihya ceremonies, the rest
belonging to the &Ccedil;rauta ritual.</p>
<p>The first of the sacraments is the <i>pum&#803;savana</i> or
ceremony aiming at the obtainment of a son. The most common expedient
prescribed is the pounded shoot of a banyan tree placed in the
wife&rsquo;s right nostril. After the birth-rites
(<i>j&#257;ta-karma</i>), the ceremony of giving the child its names
(<i>n&#257;ma-kara&#7751;a</i>) takes place, generally on the tenth day
after birth. Two are given, one being the &ldquo;secret name,&rdquo;
known only to the parents, as a protection against witchcraft, the
other for common use. Minute directions are given as to the quality of
the name; for instance, that it should contain an even number of
syllables, begin with a soft letter, and have a semi-vowel in the
middle; that for a Brahman it should end in -<i>&ccedil;arman</i>, for
a Kshatriya in -<i>varman</i>, and a Vai&ccedil;ya in -<i>gupta</i>.
Generally in the third year takes place the ceremony of tonsure
(<i>ch&#363;&#7693;&#257;-kara&#7751;a</i>), when the boy&rsquo;s hair
was cut, one or more tufts being left on the top, so that his hair
might be worn after the fashion prevailing in his family. In the
sixteenth year the rite of shaving the beard was performed. Its name,
<i>go-d&#257;na</i>, or &ldquo;gift of cows,&rdquo; is due to the fee
usually having been a couple of cattle.</p>
<p>By far the most important ceremony of boyhood was that of
apprenticeship to a teacher or initiation (<i>upanayana</i>), which in
the case of a Brahman may take place between the eighth and sixteenth
year, but a few years later in the case of the Kshatriya and the
Vai&ccedil;ya. On this occasion the youth receives a staff, a garment,
a girdle, and a cord worn over one shoulder <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name="pb253">253</a>]</span>and
under the other arm. The first is made of different wood, the others of
different materials according to caste. The sacred cord is the outward
token of the <i>&#256;rya</i> or member of one of the three highest
castes, and by investiture with it he attains his second birth, being
thenceforward a &ldquo;twice-born&rdquo; man (<i>dvi-ja</i>). The
spiritual significance of this initiation is the right to study the
Veda, and especially to recite the most sacred of prayers, the
<i>S&#257;vitr&#299;</i>. In this ceremony the teacher
(<i>&#257;ch&#257;rya</i>) who initiates the young Brahman is regarded
as his spiritual father, and the <i>S&#257;vitr&#299;</i> as his
mother.</p>
<p>The rite of <i>upanayana</i> is still practised in India. It is
based on a very old custom. The Avestan ceremony of investing the boy
of fifteen with a sacred cord upon his admission into the Zoroastrian
community shows that it goes back to Indo-Iranian times. The prevalence
among primitive races all over the world of a rite of initiation,
regarded as a second birth, upon the attainment of manhood, indicates
that it was a still older custom, which in the Brahman system became
transformed into a ceremony of admission to Vedic study.</p>
<p>Besides his studies, the course of which is regulated by detailed
rules, the constant duties of the pupil are the collection of fuel, the
performance of devotions at morning and evening twilight, begging food,
sleeping on the ground, and obedience to his teacher.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of religious studentship (<i>brahmacharya</i>),
which lasted for twelve years, or till the pupil had mastered his Veda,
he performs the rite of return (<i>sam&#257;vartana</i>), the principal
part of which is a bath, with which he symbolically washes off his
apprenticeship. He is now a <i>sn&#257;taka</i> (&ldquo;one who has
bathed&rdquo;), <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254"
name="pb254">254</a>]</span>and soon proceeds to the most important
sacrament of his life, marriage. The main elements of this ceremony
doubtless go back to the Indo-European period, and belong rather to the
sphere of witchcraft than of the sacrificial cult. The taking of her
hand placed the bride in the power of her husband. The stone on which
she stepped was to give her firmness. The seven steps which she took
with her husband, and the sacrificial food which she shared with him,
were to inaugurate friendship and community. Future abundance and male
offspring were prognosticated when she had been conducted to her
husband&rsquo;s house, by seating her on the hide of a red bull and
placing upon her lap the son of a woman who had only borne living male
children. The god most closely connected with the rite was Agni; for
the husband led his bride three times round the nuptial
fire&mdash;whence the Sanskrit name for wedding,
<i>pari-&#7751;aya</i>, &ldquo;leading round&rdquo;&mdash;and the newly
kindled domestic fire was to accompany the couple throughout life.
Offerings are made to it and Vedic formulas pronounced. After sunset
the husband leads out his bride, and as he points to the pole-star and
the star Arundhat&#299;, they exhort each other to be constant and
undivided for ever. These wedding ceremonies, preserved much as they
are described in the S&#363;tras, are still widely prevalent in the
India of to-day.</p>
<p>All the above-mentioned sacraments are exclusively meant for males,
the only one in which girls had a share being marriage
(<i>viv&#257;ha</i>). About twelve of these <i>Sam&#803;sk&#257;ras</i>
are still practised in India, investiture being still the most
important next to marriage. Some of the ceremonies only survive in a
symbolical form, as those connected with religious studentship.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name=
"pb255">255</a>]</span></p>
<p>Among the most important duties of the new householder is the
regular daily offering of the five great sacrifices
(<i>mah&#257;-yajna</i>), which are the sacrifice to the Veda
(<i>brahma-yajna</i>), or Vedic recitation; the offering to the gods
(<i>deva-yajna</i>) of melted butter in fire (<i>homa</i>); the
libation (<i>tarpa&#7751;a</i>) to the Manes
(<i>pit&#7771;i-yajna</i>); offerings (called <i>bali</i>) deposited in
various places on the ground to demons and all beings
(<i>bh&#363;ta-yajna</i>); and the sacrifice to men
(<i>manushya-yajna</i>), consisting in hospitality, especially to
Brahman mendicants. The first is regarded as by far the highest; the
recitation of the <i>s&#257;vitr&#299;</i>, in particular, at morning
and evening worship, is as meritorious as having studied the Veda. All
these five daily sacrifices are still in partial use among orthodox
Brahmans.</p>
<p>There are other sacrifices which occur periodically. Such are the
new and full moon sacrifices, in which, according to the G&#7771;ihya
ritual, a baked offering (<i>p&#257;ka-yajna</i>) is made, while,
according to the &Ccedil;rauta ceremony, cakes
(<i>puro&#7693;&#257;&ccedil;a</i>) are offered. There is, further, at
the beginning of the rains an offering made to serpents, when the use
of a raised bed is enjoined, owing to the danger from snakes at that
time. Various ceremonies are connected with the building and entering
of a new house. Detailed rules are given about the site as well as the
construction. A door on the west is, for instance, forbidden. On the
completion of the house, which is built of wood and bamboo, an animal
is sacrificed. Other ceremonies are concerned with cattle; for
instance, the release of a young bull for the benefit of the community.
Then there are agricultural ceremonies, such as the offering of the
first-fruits and rites connected with ploughing. Mention is also made
of offerings <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>to monuments (<i>chaityas</i>) erected to the
memory of teachers. There are, moreover, directions as to what is to be
done in case of evil dreams, bad omens, and disease.</p>
<p>Finally, one of the most interesting subjects with which the
G&#7771;ihya S&#363;tras deal is that of funeral rites
(<i>antyesh&#7789;i</i>) and the worship of the Manes. All but children
under two years of age are to be cremated. The dead man&rsquo;s hair
and beard are cut off and his nails trimmed, the body being anointed
with nard and a wreath being placed on the head. Before being burnt the
corpse is laid on a black antelope skin. In the case of a Kshatriya,
his bow (in that of a Brahman his staff, of a Vai&ccedil;ya his goad)
is taken from his hand, broken, and cast on the pyre, while a cow or a
goat is burnt with the corpse. Afterwards a purifying ablution is
performed by all relations to the seventh or tenth degree. They then
sit down on a grassy spot and listen to old stories or a sermon on the
transitoriness of life till the stars appear. At last, without looking
round, they return in procession to their homes, where various
observances are gone through. A death is followed by a period of
impurity, generally lasting three days, during which the relatives are
required, among other things, to sleep on the ground and refrain from
eating flesh. On the night after the death a cake is offered to the
deceased, and a libation of water is poured out; a vessel with milk and
water is also placed in the open air, and the dead man is called upon
to bathe in it. Generally after the tenth day the bones are collected
and placed in an urn, which is buried to the accompaniment of the
Rigvedic verse, &ldquo;Approach thy mother earth&rdquo; (x. 18,
10).</p>
<p>The soul is supposed to remain separated from the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name=
"pb257">257</a>]</span>Manes for a time as a <i>preta</i> or
&ldquo;ghost.&rdquo; A <i>&ccedil;r&#257;ddha</i>, or &ldquo;offering
given with faith&rdquo; (<i>&ccedil;raddh&#257;</i>), of which it is
the special object (<i>ekoddish&#7789;a</i>), is presented to it in
this state, the idea being that it would otherwise return and disquiet
the relatives. Before the expiry of a year he is admitted to the circle
of the Manes by a rite which makes him their <i>sapi&#7751;&#7693;a</i>
(&ldquo;united by the funeral cake&rdquo;). After the lapse of a year
or more another elaborate ceremony (called <i>pit&#7771;i-medha</i>)
takes place in connection with the erection of a monument, when the
bones are taken out of the urn and buried in a suitable place. There
are further various general offerings to the Manes, or
<i>&ccedil;r&#257;ddhas</i>, which take place at fixed periods, such as
that on the day of new moon (<i>p&#257;rva&#7751;a
&ccedil;r&#257;ddha</i>), while others are only occasional and
optional. These rites still play an important part in India, well-to-do
families in Bengal spending not less than 5000 to 6000 rupees on their
first <i>&ccedil;r&#257;ddha</i>.</p>
<p>From all these offerings of the G&#7771;ihya ritual are to be
distinguished the two regular sacrifices of the &Ccedil;rauta ritual,
the one called <i>Pi&#7751;&#7693;a-pit&#7771;i-yajna</i> immediately
preceding the new-moon sacrifice, the other being connected with the
third of the four-monthly sacrifices.</p>
<p>The ceremonial of ancestor-worship was especially elaborated, and
developed a special literature of its own, extending from the Vedic
period to the legal Compendia of the Middle Ages. The
<i>&Ccedil;r&#257;ddha-kalpa</i> of Hem&#257;dri comprises upwards of
1700 pages in the edition of the <i>Bibliotheca Indica</i>.</p>
<p>The above is the briefest possible sketch of the abundant material
of the G&#7771;ihya S&#363;tras, illustrating the daily domestic life
of ancient India. Perhaps, however, enough has been said to show that
they have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name=
"pb258">258</a>]</span>much human interest, and that they occupy an
important place in the history of civilisation.</p>
<p>The second branch of the S&#363;tra literature, based on tradition
or <i>Sm&#7771;iti</i>, are the Dharma S&#363;tras, which deal with the
customs of everyday life (<i>s&#257;may&#257;ch&#257;rika</i>). They
are the earliest Indian works on law, treating fully of its religious,
but only partially and briefly of its secular, aspect. The term Dharma
S&#363;tra is, strictly speaking, applied to those collections of legal
aphorisms which form part of the body of S&#363;tras belonging to a
particular branch (<i>&ccedil;&#257;kh&#257;</i>) of the Veda. In this
sense only three have been preserved, all of them attached to the
Taittir&#299;ya division of the <i>Black Yajurveda</i>. But there is
good reason to suppose that other works of the same kind which have
been preserved, or are known to have existed, were originally also
attached to individual Vedic schools. That S&#363;tras on Dharma were
composed at a very early period is shown by the fact that Y&#257;ska,
who dates from near the beginning of the S&#363;tra age, quotes legal
rules in the S&#363;tra style. Indeed, one or two of those extant must
go back to about his time.</p>
<p>The Dharma S&#363;tra which has been best preserved, and has
remained free from the influence of sectarians or modern editors, is
that of the &#256;pastambas. It forms two (28&ndash;29) of the thirty
sections of the great <i>&#256;pastamba Kalpa S&#363;tra</i>, or body
of aphorisms concerning the performance of sacrifices and the duties of
the three upper classes. It deals chiefly with the duties of the Vedic
student and of the householder, with forbidden food, purifications, and
penances, while, on the secular side, it touches upon the law of
marriage, inheritance, and crime only. From the disapprobation which
the author expresses for a certain practice of the people of the North,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name=
"pb259">259</a>]</span>it may be inferred that he belonged to the
South, where his school is known to have been settled in later times.
Owing to the pre-P&#257;&#7751;inean character of its language and
other criteria, B&uuml;hler has assigned this Dharma S&#363;tra to
about 400 <i>B.C.</i></p>
<p>Very closely connected with this work is the Dharma S&#363;tra of
Hira&#7751;yake&ccedil;in; for the differences between the two do not
go much beyond varieties of reading. In keeping with this relationship
is the tradition that Hira&#7751;yake&ccedil;in branched off from the
&#256;pastambas and founded a new school in the Konkan country on the
south-west (about Goa). The lower limit for this separation from the
&#256;pastambas is about 500 <i>A.D.</i>, when a
Hira&#7751;yake&ccedil;in Brahman is mentioned in an inscription. The
main importance of this S&#363;tra lies in its confirming, by the
parallelism of its text, the genuineness of by far the greatest part of
&#256;pastamba&rsquo;s work. It forms two (26&ndash;27) of the
twenty-nine chapters of the Kalpa S&#363;tra belonging to the school of
Hira&#7751;yake&ccedil;in.</p>
<p>The third Dharma S&#363;tra, generally styled a
<i>dharma&ccedil;&#257;stra</i> in the MSS., is that of
Baudh&#257;yana. Its position, however, within the Kalpa S&#363;tra of
its school is not so fixed as in the two previous cases. Its
subject-matter, when compared with that of &#256;pastamba&rsquo;s
Dharma S&#363;tra, indicates that it is the older of the two, just as
the more archaic and awkward style of Baudh&#257;yana&rsquo;s
G&#7771;ihya S&#363;tra shows the latter to be earlier than the
corresponding work of &#256;pastamba. The Baudh&#257;yana school cannot
be traced at the present day, but it appears to have belonged to
Southern India, where the famous Vedic commentator S&#257;ya&#7751;a
was a member of it in the fourteenth century. The subjects dealt with
in their Dharma S&#363;tra are multifarious, including <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span>the
duties of the four religious orders, the mixed castes, various kinds of
sacrifice, purification, penance, auspicious ceremonies, duties of
kings, criminal justice, examination of witnesses, law of inheritance
and marriage, the position of women. The fourth section, which is
almost entirely composed in <i>&ccedil;lokas</i>, is probably a modern
addition, and even the third is of somewhat doubtful age.</p>
<p>With the above works must be classed the well-preserved law-book of
<span class="sc">Gautama</span>. Though it does not form part of a
Kalpa S&#363;tra, it must at one time have been connected with a Vedic
school; for the Gautamas are mentioned as a subdivision of the
R&#257;&#7751;&#257;yan&#299;ya branch of the <i>S&#257;maveda</i>, and
Kum&#257;rila&rsquo;s statement that Gautama&rsquo;s treatise
originally belonged to that Veda is confirmed by the fact that its
twenty-sixth section is taken word for word from the
<i>S&#257;mavidh&#257;na Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>. Though entitled a
Dharma &Ccedil;&#257;stra, it is in style and character a regular
Dharma S&#363;tra. It is composed entirely in prose aphorisms, without
any admixture of verse, as in the other works of this class. Its varied
contents resemble and are treated much in the same way as those of the
Dharma S&#363;tra of Baudh&#257;yana. The latter has indeed been shown
to contain passages based on or borrowed from Gautama&rsquo;s work,
which is therefore the oldest Dharma S&#363;tra that has been
preserved, or at least published, and can hardly date from later than
about 500 B.C.</p>
<p>Another work of the S&#363;tra type, and belonging to the Vedic
period, is the Dharma &Ccedil;&#257;stra of <span class=
"sc">Vasish&#7789;ha</span>. It has survived only in inferior
<span class="sc">MSS.</span>, and without the preserving influence of a
commentary. It contains thirty chapters (<i>adhy&#257;yas</i>), of
which the last five appear to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261"
href="#pb261" name="pb261">261</a>]</span>consist for the most part of
late additions. Many of the S&#363;tras, not only here, but even in the
older portions, are hopelessly corrupt. The prose aphorisms of the work
are intermingled with verse, the archaic <i>trish&#7789;ubh</i> metre
being frequently employed instead of the later <i>&ccedil;lokas</i> of
Manu and others. The contents, which bear the Dharma S&#363;tra stamp,
produce the impression of antiquity in various respects. Thus here, as
in the Dharma S&#363;tra of &#256;pastamba, only six forms of marriage
are recognised, instead of the orthodox eight. Kum&#257;rila states
that in his time Vasish&#7789;ha&rsquo;s law-book, while acknowledged
to have general authority, was studied by followers of the
<i>Rigveda</i> only. That he meant the present work and no other, is
proved by the quotations from it which he gives, and which are found in
the published text. As Vasish&#7789;ha, in citing Vedic
Sam&#803;hit&#257;s and S&#363;tras, shows a predilection for works
belonging to the North of India, it is to be inferred that he or his
school belonged to that part. Vasish&#7789;ha gives a quotation from
Gautama which appears to refer to a passage in the extant text of the
latter. His various quotations from Manu are derived, not from the
later famous law-book, but evidently from a legal S&#363;tra related to
our Manu. On the other hand, the extant text of Manu contains a
quotation from Vasish&#7789;ha which actually occurs in the published
edition of the latter. Hence Vasish&#7789;ha&rsquo;s work must be later
than that of Gautama, and earlier than that of Manu. It is further
probable that the original part of the S&#363;tra of a school connected
with the <i>Rigveda</i> and belonging to the North dates from a period
some centuries before our era.</p>
<p>Some Dharma S&#363;tras are known from quotations only, the oldest
being those mentioned in other Dharma <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb262" href="#pb262" name="pb262">262</a>]</span>S&#363;tras.
Particular interest attaches to one of these, the S&#363;tra of Manu,
or the M&#257;navas, because of its relationship to the famous
<i>M&#257;nava dharma-&ccedil;&#257;stra</i>. Of the numerous
quotations from it in Vasish&#7789;ha, six are found unaltered or but
slightly modified in our text of Manu. One passage cited in
Vasish&#7789;ha is composed partly in prose and partly in verse, the
latter portion recurring in Manu. The metrical quotations show a
mixture of <i>trish&#7789;ubh</i> and <i>&ccedil;loka</i> verses, like
other Dharma S&#363;tras. These quoted fragments probably represent a
<i>M&#257;nava dharma-s&#363;tra</i> which supplied the basis of our
<i>M&#257;nava dharma-&ccedil;&#257;stra</i> or <i>Code of
Manu</i>.</p>
<p>Fragments of a legal treatise in prose and verse, attributed to the
brothers &Ccedil;ankha and Likhita, who became proverbial for justice,
have been similarly preserved. This work, which must have been
extensive, and dealt with all branches of law, is already quoted as
authoritative by Par&#257;&ccedil;ara. The statement of Kum&#257;rila
(700 A.D.) that it was connected with the V&#257;jasaneyin school of
the <span class="sc">White Yajurveda</span> is borne out by the
quotations from it which have survived.</p>
<p>S&#363;tras need not necessarily go back to the oldest period of
Indian law, as this style of composition was never entirely superseded
by the use of metre. Thus there is a <i>Vaikh&#257;nasa
dharma-s&#363;tra</i> in four <i>pra&ccedil;nas</i>, which, as internal
evidence shows, cannot be earlier than the third century A.D. It refers
to the cult of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a (Vish&#7751;u), and mentions
Wednesday by the name of <i>budha-v&#257;ra</i>, &ldquo;day of
Mercury.&rdquo; It is not a regular Dharma S&#363;tra, for it contains
nothing connected with law in the strict sense, but is only a treatise
on domestic law (<i>g&#7771;ihya-dharma</i>). It deals with the
religious duties of the four orders (<i>&#257;&ccedil;ramas</i>),
especially with those of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href=
"#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span>forest hermit. For it is with the
latter order that the Vaikh&#257;nasas, or followers of Vikhanas, are
specially connected. They seem to have been one of the youngest
offshoots of the Taittir&#299;ya school.</p>
<p>Looking back on the vast mass of ritual and usage regulated by the
S&#363;tras, we are tempted to conclude that it was entirely the
conscious work of an idle priesthood, invented to enslave and maintain
in spiritual servitude the minds of the Hindu people. But the progress
of research tends to show that the basis even of the sacerdotal ritual
of the Brahmans was popular religious observances. Otherwise it would
be hard to understand how Brahmanism acquired and retained such a hold
on the population of India. The originality of the Brahmans consisted
in elaborating and systematising observances which they already found
in existence. This they certainly succeeded in doing to an extent
unknown elsewhere.</p>
<p>Comparative studies have shown that many ritual practices go back to
the period when the Indians and Persians were still one people. Thus
the sacrifice was even then the centre of a developed ceremonial, and
was tended by a priestly class. Many terms of the Vedic ritual already
existed then, especially <i>soma</i>, which was pressed, purified
through a sieve, mixed with milk, and offered as the main libation.
Investiture with a sacred cord was, as we have seen, also known, and
was in its turn based on the still older ceremony of the initiation of
youths on entering manhood. The offering of gifts to the gods in fire
is Indo-European, as is shown by the agreement of the Greeks, Romans,
and Indians. Indo-European also is that part of the marriage ritual in
which the newly wedded couple walk round the nuptial fire, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>the
bridegroom presenting a burnt offering and the bride an offering of
grain; for among the Romans also the young pair walked round the altar
from left to right before offering bread (<i>far</i>) in the fire.
Indo-European, too, must be the practice of scattering rice or grain
(as a symbol of fertility) over the bride and bridegroom, as prescribed
in the S&#363;tras; for it is widely diffused among peoples who cannot
have borrowed it. Still older is the Indian ceremony of producing the
sacrificial fire by the friction of two pieces of wood. Similarly the
practice in the construction of the Indian fire-altar of walling up in
the lowest layer of bricks the heads of five different victims,
including that of a man, goes back to an ancient belief that a building
can only be firmly erected when a man or an animal is buried with its
foundations.</p>
<p>Finally, we have as a division of the S&#363;tras, concerned with
religious practice, the &Ccedil;ulva S&#363;tras. The thirtieth and
last <i>pra&ccedil;na</i> of the great Kalpa S&#363;tra of
&#256;pastamba is a treatise of this class. These are practical manuals
giving the measurements necessary for the construction of the
<i>vedi</i>, of the altars, and so forth. They show quite an advanced
knowledge of geometry, and constitute the oldest Indian mathematical
works.</p>
<p>The whole body of Vedic works composed in the S&#363;tra style, is
according to the Indian traditional view, divided into six classes
called Ved&#257;ngas (&ldquo;members of the Veda&rdquo;). These are
<i>&ccedil;iksh&#257;</i> or phonetics; <i>chhandas</i>, or metre;
<i>vy&#257;kara&#7751;a</i>, or grammar; <i>nirukta</i>, or etymology;
<i>kalpa</i>, or religious practice; and <i>jyotisha</i>, or astronomy.
The first four were meant as aids to the correct reciting and
understanding of the sacred texts; the last two deal with religious
rites or duties, and their proper seasons. They all have their origin
in the exigencies of religion, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265"
href="#pb265" name="pb265">265</a>]</span>and the last four furnish the
beginnings or (in one case) the full development of five branches of
science that flourished in the post-Vedic period. In the fourth and
sixth group the name of the class has been applied to designate a
particular work representing it.</p>
<p>Of <i>kalpa</i> we have already treated at length above. No work
representing astronomy has survived from the Vedic period; for the
Vedic calendar, called <i>jyotisha</i>, the two recensions of which
profess to belong to the <i>Rigveda</i> and <i>Yajurveda</i>
respectively, dates from far on in the post-Vedic age.</p>
<p>The <i>Taittir&#299;ya &#256;ra&#7751;yaka</i> (vii. 1) already
mentions <i>&ccedil;iksh&#257;</i>, or phonetics, a subject which even
then appears to have dealt with letters, accents, quantity,
pronunciation, and euphonic rules. Several works bearing the title of
<i>&ccedil;iksh&#257;</i> have been preserved, but they are only late
supplements of Vedic literature. They are short manuals containing
directions for Vedic recitation and correct pronunciation. The earliest
surviving results of phonetic studies are of course the
Sam&#803;hit&#257; texts of the various Vedas, which were edited in
accordance with euphonic rules. A further advance was made by the
constitution of the <i>pada-p&#257;&#7789;ha</i>, or word-text of the
Vedas, which, by resolving the euphonic combinations and giving each
word (even the parts of compounds) separately, in its original form
unmodified by phonetic rules, furnished a basis for all subsequent
studies. Y&#257;ska, P&#257;&#7751;ini, and other grammarians do not
always accept the analyses of the <i>Padap&#257;&#7789;has</i> when
they think they understand a Vedic form better. Patanjali even directly
contests their authoritativeness. The treatises really representative
of Vedic phonetics are the Pr&#257;ti&ccedil;&#257;khyas, which are
directly connected with the <i>Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i> and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=
"pb266">266</a>]</span><i>Padap&#257;&#7789;ha</i>. It is their object
to determine the relation of these to each other. In so doing they
furnish a systematic account of Vedic euphonic combination, besides
adding phonetic discussions to secure the correct recitation of the
sacred texts. They are generally regarded as anterior to
P&#257;&#7751;ini, who shows unmistakable points of contact with them.
It is perhaps more correct to suppose that P&#257;&#7751;ini used the
present Pr&#257;ti&ccedil;&#257;khyas in an older form, as, whenever he
touches on Vedic <i>sandhi</i>, he is always less complete in his
statements than they are, while the Pr&#257;ti&ccedil;&#257;khyas,
especially that of the <i>Atharva-veda</i>, are dependent on the
terminology of the grammarians. Four of these treatises have been
preserved and published. One belongs to the <i>Rigveda</i>, another to
the <i>Atharva</i>-, and two to the <i>Yajur-veda</i>, being attached
to the <i>V&#257;jasaneyi</i> and the <i>Taittir&#299;ya
Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i> respectively. They are so called because
intended for the use of each respective branch
(<i>&ccedil;&#257;kh&#257;</i>) of the Vedas.</p>
<p>The <i>Pr&#257;ti&ccedil;&#257;khya S&#363;tra</i> of the
<i>Rigveda</i> is an extensive metrical work in three books,
traditionally attributed to &Ccedil;aunaka, the teacher of
&#256;&ccedil;val&#257;yana; it may, however, in its present form only
be a production of the school of &Ccedil;aunaka. This
Pr&#257;ti&ccedil;&#257;khya was later epitomised, with the addition of
some supplementary matter, in a short treatise entitled
<i>Upalekha</i>. The <i>Taittir&#299;ya
Pr&#257;ti&ccedil;&#257;khya</i> is particularly interesting owing to
the various peculiar names of teachers occurring among the twenty which
it mentions. The <i>V&#257;jasaneyi Pr&#257;ti&ccedil;&#257;khya</i>,
in eight chapters, names K&#257;ty&#257;yana as its author, and
mentions &Ccedil;aunaka among other predecessors. The <i>Atharva-veda
Pr&#257;ti&ccedil;&#257;khya</i>, in four chapters, belonging to the
school of the &Ccedil;aunakas, is more grammatical than the other works
of this class. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name=
"pb267">267</a>]</span></p>
<p>Metre, to which there are many scattered references in the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;as, is separately treated in a section of the
<i>&Ccedil;&#257;nkh&#257;yana &Ccedil;rauta S&#363;tra</i> (7, 27), in
the last three sections (<i>pa&#7789;alas</i>) of the <i>Rigveda
Pr&#257;ti&ccedil;&#257;khya</i>, and especially in the <i>Nid&#257;na
S&#363;tra</i>, which belongs to the <i>S&#257;maveda</i>. A part of
the <i>Chhandah&#803; S&#363;tra</i> of Pingala also deals with Vedic
metres; but though it claims to be a Ved&#257;nga, it is in reality a
late supplement, dealing chiefly with post-Vedic prosody, on which,
indeed, it is the standard authority.</p>
<p>Finally, K&#257;ty&#257;yana&rsquo;s two Anukrama&#7751;&#299;s or
indices, mentioned below, each contains a section, varying but slightly
from the other, on Vedic metres. These sections are, however, almost
identical in matter with the sixteenth <i>pa&#7789;ala</i> of the
<i>Rigveda Pr&#257;ti&ccedil;&#257;khya</i>, and may possibly be older
than the corresponding passage in the
<i>Pr&#257;ti&ccedil;&#257;khya</i>, though the latter work as a whole
is doubtless anterior to the <i>Anukrama&#7751;&#299;</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Padap&#257;&#7789;has</i> show that their authors had not
only made investigations as to pronunciation and <i>Sandhi</i>, but
already knew a good deal about the grammatical analysis of words; for
they separate both the parts of compounds and the prefixes of verbs, as
well as certain suffixes and terminations of nouns. They had doubtless
already distinguished the four parts of speech
(<i>padaj&#257;t&#257;ni</i>), though these are first mentioned by
Y&#257;ska as <i>n&#257;man</i>, or &ldquo;noun&rdquo; (including
<i>sarva-n&#257;man</i>, &ldquo;representing all nouns&rdquo; or
&ldquo;pronouns&rdquo;), <i>&#257;khy&#257;ta</i>,
&ldquo;predicate,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;verb&rdquo;;
<i>upasarga</i>, &ldquo;supplement,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>
&ldquo;preposition&rdquo;; nip&#257;ta, &ldquo;incidental
addition,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;particle.&rdquo; It is perhaps to
the separation of these categories that the name for grammar,
<i>vy&#257;kara&#7751;a</i>, originally referred, rather than to the
analysis of words. Even the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as bear evidence
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>of linguistic investigations, for they mention
various grammatical terms, such as &ldquo;letter&rdquo;
(<i>var&#7751;a</i>), &ldquo;masculine&rdquo; (<i>v&#7771;ishan</i>),
&ldquo;number&rdquo; (<i>vachana</i>), &ldquo;case-form&rdquo;
(<i>vibhakti</i>).Still more such references are to be found in the
&#256;ra&#7751;yakas, the Upanishads, and the S&#363;tras. But the most
important information we have of pre-P&#257;&#7751;inean grammar is
that found in Y&#257;ska&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Grammatical studies must have been cultivated to a considerable
extent before Y&#257;ska&rsquo;s time, for he distinguishes a Northern
and an Eastern school, besides mentioning nearly twenty predecessors,
among whom &Ccedil;&#257;ka&#7789;&#257;yana, G&#257;rgya, and
&Ccedil;&#257;kalya are the most important. By the time of Y&#257;ska
grammarians had learned to distinguish clearly between the stem and the
formative elements of words; recognising the personal terminations and
the tense affixes of the verb on the one hand, and primary
(<i>k&#7771;it</i>) or secondary (<i>taddhita</i>) nominal suffixes on
the other. Y&#257;ska has an interesting discussion on the theory of
&Ccedil;&#257;ka&#7789;&#257;yana, which he himself follows, that nouns
are derived from verbs. G&#257;rgya and some other grammarians, he
shows, admit this theory in a general way, but deny that it is
applicable to all nouns. He criticises their objections, and finally
dismisses them as untenable. On
&Ccedil;&#257;ka&#7789;&#257;yana&rsquo;s theory of the verbal origin
of nouns the whole system of P&#257;&#7751;ini is founded. The
s&#363;tra of that grammarian contains hundreds of rules dealing with
Vedic forms; but these are of the nature of exceptions to the main body
of his rules, which are meant to describe the Sanskrit language. His
work almost entirely dominates the subsequent literature. Though
belonging to the middle of the S&#363;tra period, it must be regarded
as the definite starting-point of the post-Vedic age. Coming to be
regarded as an infallible <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href=
"#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span>authority, P&#257;&#7751;ini
superseded all his predecessors, whose works have consequently
perished. Y&#257;ska alone survives, and that only because he was not
directly a grammarian; for his work represents, and alone represents,
the Ved&#257;nga &ldquo;etymology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Y&#257;ska&rsquo;s <i>Nirukta</i> is in reality a Vedic commentary,
and is older by some centuries than any other exegetical work preserved
in Sanskrit. Its bases are the <i>Nigha&#7751;&#7789;us</i>,
collections of rare or obscure Vedic words, arranged for the use of
teachers. Y&#257;ska had before him five such collections. The first
three contain groups of synonyms, the fourth specially difficult words,
and the fifth a classification of the Vedic gods. These Y&#257;ska
explained for the most part in the twelve books of his commentary (to
which two others were added later). In so doing he adduces as examples
a large number of verses, chiefly from the <i>Rigveda</i>, which he
interprets with many etymological remarks.</p>
<p>The first book is an introduction, dealing with the principles of
grammar and exegesis. The second and third elucidate certain points in
the synonymous <i>nigha&#7751;&#7789;us</i>; Books IV.&ndash;VI.
comment on the fourth section, and VII.&ndash;XII. on the fifth. The
<i>Nirukta</i>, besides being very important from the point of view of
exegesis and grammar, is highly interesting as the earliest specimen of
Sanskrit prose of the classical type, considerably earlier than
P&#257;&#7751;ini himself. Y&#257;ska already uses essentially the same
grammatical terminology as P&#257;&#7751;ini, employing, for instance,
the same words for root (<i>dh&#257;tu</i>), primary, and secondary
suffixes. But he must have lived a long time before P&#257;&#7751;ini;
for a considerable number of important grammarians&rsquo; names are
mentioned between them. Y&#257;ska must, therefore, go back to the
fifth century, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270"
name="pb270">270</a>]</span>undoubtedly belongs to the beginning of the
S&#363;tra period.</p>
<p>One point of very great importance proved by the <i>Nirukta</i> is
that the <i>Rigveda</i> had a very fixed form in Y&#257;ska&rsquo;s
time, and was essentially identical with our text. His deviations are
very insignificant. Thus in one passage (X. 29. I) he reads
<i>v&#257;y&oacute;</i> as one word, against <i>v&#257; y&oacute;</i>
as two words in &Ccedil;&#257;kalya&rsquo;s Pada text.
Y&#257;ska&rsquo;s paraphrases show that he also occasionally differed
from the Sam&#803;hit&#257; text, though the quotations themselves from
the <i>Rigveda</i> have been corrected so as to agree absolutely with
the traditional text. But these slight variations are probably due to
mistakes in the <i>Nirukta</i> rather than to varieties of reading in
the <i>Rigveda</i>. There are a few insignificant deviations of this
kind even in S&#257;ya&#7751;a, but they are always manifestly
oversights on the part of the commentator.</p>
<p>To the S&#363;tras is attached a very extensive literature of
<i>Pari&ccedil;ish&#7789;as</i> or &ldquo;supplements,&rdquo; which
seem to have existed in all the Vedic schools. They contain details on
matters only touched upon in the S&#363;tras, or supplementary
information about subjects not dealt with at all by them. Thus, there
is the <i>&#256;&ccedil;val&#257;yana
G&#7771;ihya-pari&ccedil;ish&#7789;a</i>, in four chapters, connected
with the <i>Rigveda</i>. The <i>Gobhila
sam&#803;graha-pari&ccedil;ish&#7789;a</i> is a compendium of
G&#7771;ihya practices in general, with a special leaning towards
magical rites, which came to be attached to the <i>S&#257;maveda</i>.
Closely related to, and probably later than this work, is the
<i>Karma-prad&#299;pa</i> (&ldquo;lamp of rites&rdquo;), also variously
called <i>s&#257;ma-g&#7771;ihya-</i> or
<i>chh&#257;ndogyag&#7771;ihya-pari&ccedil;ish&#7789;a</i>,
<i>chhandoga-pari&ccedil;ish&#7789;a</i>, <i>Gobhila-sm&#7771;iti</i>,
attributed to the K&#257;ty&#257;yana of the <i>White Yajurveda</i> or
to Gobhila. It deals with the same subjects, though independently, as
the <i>G&#7771;ihya <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271"
name="pb271">271</a>]</span>sam&#803;graha</i>, with which it
occasionally agrees in whole <i>&ccedil;lokas</i>.</p>
<p>Of great importance for the understanding of the sacrificial
ceremonial are the Prayogas (&ldquo;Manuals&rdquo;) and Paddhatis
(&ldquo;Guides&rdquo;), of which a vast number exist in manuscript.
These works represent both the &Ccedil;rauta and the G&#7771;ihya
ritual according to the various schools. The Prayogas describe the
course of each sacrifice and the functions of the different groups of
priests, solely from the point of view of practical performance, while
the Paddhatis rather follow the systematic accounts of the S&#363;tras
and sketch their contents. There are also versified accounts of the
ritual called <i>K&#257;rik&#257;s</i>, which are directly attached to
S&#363;tras or to Paddhatis. The oldest of them appears to be the
<i>K&#257;rik&#257;</i> of Kum&#257;rila (c. 700 A.D.).</p>
<p>Of a supplementary character are also the class of writings called
Anukrama&#7751;&#299;s or Vedic Indices, which give lists of the hymns,
the authors, the metres, and the deities in the order in which they
occur in the various Sam&#803;hit&#257;s. To the <i>Rigveda</i>
belonged seven of these works, all attributed to &Ccedil;aunaka, and
composed in the mixture of the <i>&ccedil;loka</i> and
<i>trish&#7789;ubh</i> metre, which is also found in
&Ccedil;aunaka&rsquo;s <i>Rigveda Pr&#257;ti&ccedil;&#257;khya</i>.
There is also a General Index or <i>Sarv&#257;nukrama&#7751;&#299;</i>
which is attributed to K&#257;ty&#257;yana, and epitomises in the
S&#363;tra style the contents of the metrical indices. Of the metrical
indices five have been preserved. The
<i>&#256;rsh&#257;nukrama&#7751;&#299;</i>, containing rather less than
300 <i>&ccedil;lokas</i>, gives a list of the Rishis or authors of the
<i>Rigveda</i>. Its present text represents a modernised form of that
which was known to the commentator Sha&#7693;guru&ccedil;ishya in the
twelfth century. The <i>Chhandonukrama&#7751;&#299;</i>, which is of
almost <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span>exactly the same length, enumerates the metres
in which the hymns of the <i>Rigveda</i> are composed. It also states
for each book the number of verses in each metre as well as the
aggregate in all metres. The
<i>Anuv&#257;k&#257;nukrama&#7751;&#299;</i> is a short index
containing only about forty verses. It states the initial words of each
of the eighty-five <i>anuv&#257;kas</i> or lessons into which the
<i>Rigveda</i> is divided, and the number of hymns contained in these
<i>anuv&#257;kas</i>. It further states that the <i>Rigveda</i>
contains 1017 hymns (or 1025 according to the V&#257;shkala recension),
10,580&ndash;1/2 verses, 153,826 words, 432,000 syllables, besides some
other statistical details. The number of verses given does not exactly
tally with various calculations that have recently been made, but the
differences are only slight, and may be due to the way in which certain
repeated verses were counted by the author of the index.</p>
<p>There is another short index, known as yet only in two MSS., called
the <i>P&#257;d&#257;nukrama&#7751;&#299;</i>, or &ldquo;index of
lines&rdquo; (<i>p&#257;das</i>), and composed in the same mixed metre
as the others. The <i>S&#363;kt&#257;nukrama&#7751;&#299;</i>, which
has not survived, and is only known by name, probably consisted only of
the initial words (<i>prat&#299;kas</i>) of the hymns. It probably
perished because the <i>Sarv&#257;nukrama&#7751;&#299;</i> would have
rendered such a work superfluous. No MS. of the
<i>Devat&#257;nukrama&#7751;&#299;</i> or &ldquo;Index of gods&rdquo;
exists, but ten quotations from it have been preserved by the
commentator Sha&#7693;guru&ccedil;ishya. It must have been superseded
by the <i>B&#7771;ihaddevat&#257;</i>, an index of the &ldquo;many
gods,&rdquo; a much more extensive work than any of the other
Anukrama&#7751;&#299;s, as it contains about 1200 <i>&ccedil;lokas</i>
interspersed with occasional <i>trish&#7789;ubhs</i>. It is divided
into eight <i>adhy&#257;yas</i> corresponding to the
<i>ash&#7789;akas</i> of the <i>Rigveda</i>. Following <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name="pb273">273</a>]</span>the
order of the <i>Rigveda</i>, its main object is to state the deity for
each verse. But as it contains a large number of illustrative myths and
legends, it is of great value as an early collection of stories. It is
to a considerable extent based on Y&#257;ska&rsquo;s <i>Nirukta</i>.
Besides Y&#257;ska himself and other teachers named by that scholar, it
also mentions Bh&#257;guri and &#256;&ccedil;val&#257;yana as well as
the <i>Nid&#257;na S&#363;tra</i>, A peculiarity of this work is that
it refers to a number of supplementary hymns (<i>khilas</i>) which do
not form part of the canonical text of the <i>Rigveda</i>.</p>
<p>Later, at least, than the original form of these metrical
Anukrama&#7751;&#299;s, is the <i>Sarv&#257;nukrama&#7751;&#299;</i> of
<span class="sc">K&#257;ty&#257;yana</span>, which combines the data
contained in them within the compass of a single work. Composed in the
S&#363;tra style, it is of considerable length, occupying about
forty-six pages in the printed edition. For every hymn in the
<i>Rigveda</i> it states the initial word or words, the number of its
verses, as well as the author, the deity, and the metre, even for
single verses. There is an introduction in twelve sections, nine of
which form a short treatise on Vedic metres corresponding to the last
three sections of the <i>Rigveda Pr&#257;ti&ccedil;&#257;khya</i>. The
author begins with the statement that he is going to supply an index of
the <i>prat&#299;kas</i> and so forth of the <i>Rigveda</i> according
to the authorities (<i>yathopade&ccedil;am</i>), because without such
knowledge the &Ccedil;rauta and Sm&#257;rta rites cannot be
accomplished. These authorities are doubtless the metrical indices
described above. For the text of the
<i>Sarv&#257;nukrama&#7751;&#299;</i>, which is composed in a concise
S&#363;tra style, not only contains some metrical lines
(<i>p&#257;das</i>), but also a number of passages either directly
taken from the <i>&#256;rsh&#257;nukrama&#7751;&#299;</i> and the
<i>B&#7771;ihaddevat&#257;</i>, or with their metrical wording but
slightly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name=
"pb274">274</a>]</span>altered. Another metrical work attributed to
&Ccedil;aunaka is the <i>&#7770;igvidh&#257;na</i>, which describes the
magical effects produced by the recitation of hymns or single verses of
the <i>Rigveda</i>.</p>
<p>To the Pari&ccedil;ish&#7789;as of the <i>S&#257;maveda</i> belong
the two indices called <i>&#256;rsha</i> and <i>Daivata</i>,
enumerating respectively the Rishis and deities of the text of the
Naigeya branch of the <i>S&#257;maveda</i>. They quote Y&#257;ska,
&Ccedil;aunaka, and &#256;&ccedil;val&#257;yana among others. There are
also two Anukrama&#7751;&#299;s attached to the <i>Black Yajurveda</i>.
That of the &#256;treya school consists of two parts, the first of
which is in prose, and the second in <i>&ccedil;lokas</i>. It contains
little more than an enumeration of names referring to the contents of
its Sam&#803;hit&#257;. The Anukrama&#7751;&#299; of the
Ch&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;&#299;ya school of the
<i>K&#257;&#7789;haka</i> is an index of the authors of the various
sections and verses. Its statements regarding passages derived from the
<i>Rigveda</i> differ much from those of the
<i>Sarv&#257;nukrama&#7751;&#299;</i> of the <i>Rigveda</i>, giving a
number of totally new names. It claims to be the work of Atri, who
communicated it to Laug&#257;kshi. The <i>Anukrama&#7751;&#299;</i> of
the <i>White Yajurveda</i> in the M&#257;dhyam&#803;dina recension,
attributed to K&#257;ty&#257;yana, consists of five sections. The first
four are an index of authors, deities, and metres. The authors of
verses taken from the <i>Rigveda</i> generally agree with those in the
<i>Sarv&#257;nukrama&#7751;&#299;</i>. There are, however, a good many
exceptions, several new names belonging to a later period, some even to
that of the <i>&Ccedil;atapatha Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>. The fifth
section gives a summary account of the metres occurring in the text. It
is identical with the corresponding portion of the introduction to the
<i>Sarv&#257;nukrama&#7751;&#299;</i>, which was probably the original
position of the section. There are many other Pari&ccedil;ish&#7789;as
of the <i>White Yajurveda</i>, all attributed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span>to
K&#257;ty&#257;yana. Only three of these need be mentioned here. The
<i>Nigama-pari&ccedil;ish&#7789;a</i>, a glossary of synonymous words
occurring in the <i>White Yajurveda</i>, has a lexicographical
interest. The <i>Pravar&#257;dhy&#257;ya</i>, or &ldquo;Chapter on
Ancestors,&rdquo; is a list of Brahman families drawn up for the
purpose of determining the forbidden degrees of relationship in
marriage, and of indicating the priests suitable for the performance of
sacrifice. The <i>Chara&#7751;a-vy&#363;ha</i>, or &ldquo;Exposition of
the Schools&rdquo; of the various Vedas, is a very late work of little
importance, giving a far less complete enumeration of the Vedic schools
than certain sections of the <i>Vish&#7751;u-</i> and the
<i>V&#257;yu-Pur&#257;&#7751;a</i>. There is also a
<i>Chara&#7751;a-vy&#363;ha</i> among the Pari&ccedil;ish&#7789;as of
the <i>Atharva-veda</i>, which number upwards of seventy. This work
makes the statement that the <i>Atharva</i> contains 2000 hymns and
12,380 verses.</p>
<p>In concluding this account of Vedic literature, I cannot omit to say
a few words about <span class="sc">S&#257;ya&#7751;a</span>, the great
medi&aelig;val Vedic scholar, to whom or to whose initiation we owe a
number of valuable commentaries on the <i>Rigveda</i>, the <i>Aitareya
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i> and <i>&#256;ra&#7751;yaka</i>, as well as the
<i>Taittir&#299;ya Sam&#803;hit&#257;</i>, <i>Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>,
and <i>&#256;ra&#7751;yaka</i>, besides a number of other works. His
comments on the two Sam&#803;hit&#257;s would appear to have been only
partially composed by himself and to have been completed by his pupils.
He died in 1387, having written his works under Bukka I.
(1350&ndash;79), whose teacher and minister he calls himself, and his
successor, Harihara (1379&ndash;99). These princes belonged to a family
which, throwing off the Muhammadan yoke in the earlier half of the
fourteenth century, founded the dynasty of Vijayanagara (&ldquo;city of
victory&rdquo;), now Hampi, on the Tungabhadr&#257;, in the Bellary
district. S&#257;ya&#7751;a&rsquo;s elder brother, M&#257;dhava, was
minister of King <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276"
name="pb276">276</a>]</span>Bukka, and died as abbot of the monastery
of &Ccedil;&#7771;ingeri, under the name of
Vidy&#257;ra&#7751;yasv&#257;min. Not only did he too produce works of
his own, but S&#257;ya&#7751;a&rsquo;s commentaries, as composed under
his patronage, were dedicated to him as <i>m&#257;dhav&#299;ya</i>, or
(&ldquo;influenced by M&#257;dhava&rdquo;). By an interesting
coincidence Professor Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s second edition of the
<i>Rigveda</i>, with the commentary of S&#257;ya&#7751;a, was brought
out under the auspices of a Mah&#257;r&#257;ja of Vijayanagara. The
latter city has, however, nothing to do with that from which King Bukka
derived his title. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In turning from the Vedic to the Sanskrit period, we
are confronted with a literature which is essentially different from
that of the earlier age in matter, spirit, and form. Vedic literature
is essentially religious; Sanskrit literature, abundantly developed in
every other direction, is profane. But, doubtless as a result of the
speculative tendencies of the Upanishads, a moralising spirit at the
same time breathes through it as a whole. The religion itself which now
prevails is very different from that of the Vedic age. For in the new
period the three great gods, Brahm&#257;, Vish&#7751;u, and &Ccedil;iva
are the chief objects of worship. The important deities of the Veda
have sunk to a subordinate position, though Indra is still relatively
prominent as the chief of a warrior&rsquo;s heaven. Some new gods of
lesser rank have arisen, such as Kubera, god of wealth;
Ga&#7751;e&ccedil;a, god of learning; K&#257;rttikeya, god of war;
&Ccedil;r&#299; or Lakshm&#299;, goddess of beauty and fortune;
Durg&#257; or P&#257;rvat&#299;, the terrible spouse of &Ccedil;iva;
besides the serpent deities and several classes of demigods and
demons.</p>
<p>While the spirit of Vedic literature, at least in its earlier phase,
is optimistic, Sanskrit poetry is pervaded by <i>Weltschmerz</i>,
resulting from the now universally <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278"
href="#pb278" name="pb278">278</a>]</span>accepted doctrine of
transmigration. To that doctrine, according to which beings pass by
gradations from Brahm&#257; through men and animals to the lowest forms
of existence, is doubtless also largely due the fantastic element
characteristic of this later poetry. Here, for instance, we read of
Vish&#7751;u coming down to earth in the shape of animals, of sages and
saints wandering between heaven and earth, of human kings visiting
Indra in heaven.</p>
<p>Hand in hand with this fondness for introducing the marvellous and
supernatural into the description of human events goes a tendency to
exaggeration. Thus King Vi&ccedil;v&#257;mitra, we are told, practised
penance for thousands of years in succession; and the power of
asceticism is described as so great as to cause even the worlds and the
gods to tremble. The very bulk of the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>,
consisting as it does of more than 200,000 lines, is a concrete
illustration of this defective sense of proportion.</p>
<p>As regards the form in which it is presented to us, Sanskrit
literature contrasts with that of both the earlier and the later Vedic
period. While prose was employed in the Yajurvedas and the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;as, and finally attained to a certain degree of
development, it almost disappears in Sanskrit, nearly every branch of
literature being treated in verse, often much to the detriment of the
subject, as in the case of law. The only departments almost entirely
restricted to the use of prose are grammar and philosophy, but the
cramped and enigmatical style in which these subjects are treated
hardly deserves the name of prose at all. Literary prose is found only
in fables, fairy tales, romances, and partially in the drama. In
consequence of this neglect, the prose of the later period compares
unfavourably with that of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as. Even the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>style of the romances or prose
<i>k&#257;vyas</i>, subject as it is to the strict rules of poetics, is
as clumsy as that of the grammatical commentaries; for the use of
immense compounds, like those of the S&#363;tras, is one of its
essential characteristics.</p>
<p>Sanskrit literature, then, resembles that of the earlier Vedic age
in being almost entirely metrical. But the metres in which it is
written, though nearly all based on those of the Veda, are different.
The bulk of the literature is composed in the <i>&ccedil;loka</i>, a
development of the Vedic <i>anush&#7789;ubh</i> stanza of four
octosyllabic lines; but while all four lines ended iambically in the
prototype, the first and third line have in the <i>&ccedil;loka</i>
acquired a trochaic rhythm. The numerous other metres employed in the
classical poetry have become much more elaborate than their Vedic
originals by having the quantity of every syllable in the line strictly
determined.</p>
<p>The style, too, excepting the two old epics, is in Sanskrit poetry
made more artificial by the frequent use of long compounds, as well as
by the application of the elaborate rules of poetics, while the
language is regulated by the grammar of P&#257;&#7751;ini. Thus
classical Sanskrit literature, teeming as it does with fantastic and
exaggerated ideas, while bound by the strictest rules of form, is like
a tropical garden full of luxuriant and rank growth, in which, however,
many a fair flower of true poetry may be culled.</p>
<p>It is impossible even for the Sanskrit scholar who has not lived in
India to appreciate fully the merits of this later poetry, much more so
for those who can only become acquainted with it in translations. For,
in the first place, the metres, artificial and elaborate though they
are, have a beauty of their own which cannot <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name="pb280">280</a>]</span>be
reproduced in other languages. Again, to understand it thoroughly, the
reader must have seen the tropical plains and forests of Hindustan
steeped in intense sunshine or bathed in brilliant moonlight; he must
have viewed the silent ascetic seated at the foot of the sacred
fig-tree; he must have experienced the feelings inspired by the
approach of the monsoon; he must have watched beast and bird disporting
themselves in tank and river; he must know the varying aspects of
Nature in the different seasons; in short, he must be acquainted with
all the sights and sounds of an Indian landscape, the mere allusion to
one of which may call up some familiar scene or touch some chord of
sentiment. Otherwise, for instance, the mango-tree, the red
A&ccedil;oka, the orange Kadamba, the various creepers, the different
kinds of lotus, the mention of each of which should convey a vivid
picture, are but empty names. Without a knowledge, moreover, of the
habits, modes of thought, and traditions of the people, much must
remain meaningless. But those who are properly equipped can see many
beauties in classical Sanskrit poetry which are entirely lost to
others. Thus a distinguished scholar known to the present writer has
entered so fully into the spirit of that poetry, that he is unable to
derive pleasure from any other.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake to suppose that Sanskrit literature came into
being only at the close of the Vedic period, or that it merely forms
its continuation and development. As a profane literature, it must, in
its earliest phases, which are lost, have been contemporaneous with the
religious literature of the Vedas. Beside the productions of the latest
Vedic period, that of the Upanishads and S&#363;tras, there grew up, on
the one hand, the rich <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href=
"#pb281" name="pb281">281</a>]</span>P&#257;li literature of Buddhism,
and, on the other, the earliest form of Sanskrit poetry in the shape of
epic tales. We have seen that even the <i>Rigveda</i> contains some
hymns of a narrative character. Later we find in the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;as a number of short legends, mostly in prose, but
sometimes partly metrical, as the story of
&Ccedil;unah&#803;&ccedil;epa in the <i>Aitareya</i>. Again, the
<i>Nirukta</i>, which must date from the fifth century B.C., contains
many prose tales, and the oldest existing collection of Vedic legend,
the metrical <i>B&#7771;ihaddevat&#257;</i>, cannot belong to a much
later time.</p>
<p>Sanskrit epic poetry falls into two main classes. That which
comprises old stories goes by the name of <i>Itih&#257;sa</i>,
&ldquo;legend,&rdquo; <i>&#256;khy&#257;na</i>,
&ldquo;narrative,&rdquo; or <i>Pur&#257;&#7751;a</i>, &ldquo;ancient
tale,&rdquo; while the other is called <i>K&#257;vya</i> or artificial
epic. The <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> is the chief and oldest
representative of the former group, the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i>
of the latter. Both these great epics are composed in the same form of
the <i>&ccedil;loka</i> metre as that employed in classical Sanskrit
poetry. The <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>, however, also contains, as
remnants of an older phase, archaic verses in the <i>upaj&#257;ti</i>
and <i>vam&#803;&ccedil;astha</i> (developments of the Vedic
<i>trish&#7789;ubh</i> and <i>jagat&#299;</i>) metres, besides
preserving some old prose stories in what is otherwise an entirely
metrical work. It further differs from the sister epic in introducing
speeches with words, such as &ldquo;B&#7771;ihada&ccedil;va
spake,&rdquo; which do not form part of the verse, and which may be
survivals of prose narrative connecting old epic songs. The
<i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i>, again, is, in the main, the work of a
single poet, homogeneous in plan and execution, composed in the east of
India. The <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>, arising in the western half of
the country, is a congeries of parts, the only unity about which is the
connectedness of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282"
name="pb282">282</a>]</span>epic cycle with which they deal; its epic
kernel, moreover, which forms only about one-fifth of the whole work,
has become so overgrown with didactic matter, that in its final shape
it is not an epic at all, but an encyclop&aelig;dia of moral
teaching.</p>
<p>The <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>, which in its present form consists
of over 100,000 <i>&ccedil;lokas</i>, equal to about eight times as
much as the Iliad and Odyssey put together, is by far the longest poem
known to literary history. It is a conglomerate of epic and didactic
matter divided into eighteen books called <i>parvan</i>, with a
nineteenth, the <i>Harivam&#803;&ccedil;a</i>, as a supplement. The
books vary very considerably in length, the twelfth being the longest,
with nearly 14,000, the seventeenth the shortest, with only 312
<i>&ccedil;lokas</i>. All the eighteen books, excepting the eighth and
the last three, are divided into subordinate <i>parvans</i>; each book
is also cut up into chapters (<i>adhy&#257;yas</i>).</p>
<p>No European edition of the whole epic has yet been undertaken. This
remains one of the great tasks reserved for the future of Sanskrit
philology, and can only be accomplished by the collaboration of several
scholars. There are complete <span class="sc">MSS.</span> of the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> in London, Oxford, Paris, and Berlin,
besides many others in different parts of India; while the number of
<span class="sc">MSS.</span> containing only parts of the poem can
hardly be counted.</p>
<p>Three main editions of the epic have appeared in India. The
<i>editio princeps</i>, including the <i>Harivam&#803;&ccedil;a</i>,
but without any commentary, was published in four volumes at Calcutta
in 1834&ndash;39. Another and better edition, which has subsequently
been reproduced several times, was printed at Bombay in 1863. This
edition, though not including the supplementary book, contains the
commentary <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name=
"pb283">283</a>]</span>of N&#299;laka&#7751;&#7789;ha. These two
editions do not on the whole differ considerably. Being derived from a
common source, they represent one and the same recension. The Bombay
edition, however, generally has the better readings. It contains about
200 <i>&ccedil;lokas</i> more than the Calcutta edition, but these
additions are of no importance.</p>
<p>A third edition, printed in Telugu characters, was published in four
volumes at Madras in 1855&ndash;60. It includes the
<i>Harivam&#803;&ccedil;a</i> and extracts from
N&#299;laka&#7751;&#7789;ha&rsquo;s commentary. This edition represents
a distinct South Indian recension, which seems to differ from that of
the North about as much as the three recensions of the
<i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> do from one another. Both recensions
are of about equal length, omissions in the first being compensated by
others in the second. Sometimes one has the better text, sometimes the
other.</p>
<p>The epic kernel of the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> or the
&ldquo;Great Battle of the descendants of Bharata,&rdquo; consisting of
about 20,000 <i>&ccedil;lokas</i>, describes the eighteen days&rsquo;
fight between Duryodhana, leader of the Kurus, and Yudhish&#7789;hira,
chief of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;us, who were cousins, both descended
from King Bharata, son of &Ccedil;akuntal&#257;. Within this narrative
frame has come to be included a vast number of old legends about gods,
kings, and sages; accounts of cosmogony and theogony; disquisitions on
philosophy, law, religion, and the duties of the military caste. These
lengthy and heterogeneous interpolations render it very difficult to
follow the thread of the narrative. Entire works are sometimes inserted
to illustrate a particular statement. Thus, while the two armies are
drawn up prepared for battle, a whole philosophical poem, in eighteen
cantos, the <i>Bhagavadg&#299;t&#257;</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb284" href="#pb284" name="pb284">284</a>]</span>is recited to the
hero Arjuna, who hesitates to advance and fight against his kin. Hence
the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> claims to be not only a heroic poem
(<i>k&#257;vya</i>), but a compendium teaching, in accordance with the
Veda, the fourfold end of human existence (spiritual merit, wealth,
pleasure, and salvation), a <i>sm&#7771;iti</i> or work of sacred
tradition, which expounds the whole duty of man, and is intended for
the religious instruction of all Hindus. Thus, in one (I. lxii. 35) of
many similar passages, it makes the statement about itself that
&ldquo;this collection of all sacred texts, in which the greatness of
cows and Brahmans is exalted, must be listened to by virtuous-minded
men.&rdquo; Its title, <i>K&#257;rsh&#7751;a Veda</i>, or &ldquo;Veda
of K&#7771;ish&#7751;a&rdquo; (a form of Vish&#7751;u), the occurrence
of a famous invocation of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a and Nara (names of
Vish&#7751;u) and Sarasvat&#299; (Vish&#7751;u&rsquo;s wife) at the
beginning of each of its larger sections, and the prevalence of
Vishnuite doctrines throughout the work, prove it to have been a
<i>sm&#7771;iti</i> of the ancient Vishnuite sect of the
Bh&#257;gavatas.</p>
<p>Thus it is clear that the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> in its
present shape contains an epic nucleus, that it favours the worship of
Vish&#7751;u, and that it has become a comprehensive didactic work. We
further find in Book I. the direct statements that the poem at one time
contained 24,000 <i>&ccedil;lokas</i> before the episodes
(<i>up&#257;khy&#257;na</i>) were added, that it originally consisted
of only 8800 <i>&ccedil;lokas</i>, and that it has three beginnings.
These data render it probable that the epic underwent three stages of
development from the time it first assumed definite shape; and this
conclusion is corroborated by various internal and external
arguments.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that the original kernel of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name="pb285">285</a>]</span>the
epic has as a historical background an ancient conflict between the two
neighbouring tribes of the Kurus and Panch&#257;las, who finally
coalesced into a single people. In the Yajurvedas these two tribes
already appear united, and in the <i>K&#257;&#7789;haka</i> King
Dh&#7771;itar&#257;sh&#7789;ra Vaichitrav&#299;rya, one of the chief
figures of the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>, is mentioned as a
well-known person. Hence the historical germ of the great epic is to be
traced to a very early period, which cannot well be later than the
tenth century B.C. Old songs about the ancient feud and the heroes who
played a part in it, must have been handed down by word of mouth and
recited in popular assemblies or at great public sacrifices.</p>
<p>These disconnected battle-songs were, we must assume, worked up by
some poetic genius into a comparatively short epic, describing the
tragic fate of the Kuru race, who, with justice and virtue on their
side, perished through the treachery of the victorious sons of
P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u, with K&#7771;ish&#7751;a at their head. To the
period of this original epic doubtless belong the traces the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> has preserved unchanged of the heroic
spirit and the customs of ancient times, so different from the later
state of things which the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> as a whole
reflects. To this period also belongs the figure of Brahm&#257; as the
highest god. The evidence of P&#257;li literature shows that
Brahm&#257; already occupied that position in Buddha&rsquo;s time. We
may, then, perhaps assume that the original form of our epic came into
being about the fifth century B.C. The oldest evidence we have for the
existence of the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> in some shape or other is
to be found in &#256;&ccedil;val&#257;yana&rsquo;s G&#7771;ihya
S&#363;tra, where a <i>Bh&#257;rata</i> and
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> are mentioned. This would also point to
about the fifth century B.C. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href=
"#pb286" name="pb286">286</a>]</span></p>
<p>To the next stage, in which the epic, handed down by rhapsodists,
swelled to a length of about 20,000 <i>&ccedil;lokas</i>, belongs the
representation of the victorious P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;us in a
favourable light, and the introduction on a level with Brahm&#257; of
the two other great gods, &Ccedil;iva, and especially Vish&#7751;u, of
whom K&#7771;ish&#7751;a appears as an incarnation.</p>
<p>We gather from the account of Megasthenes that about 300 B.C., these
two gods were already prominent, and the people were divided into
&Ccedil;ivaites and Vishnuites. Moreover, the Yavanas or Greeks are
mentioned in the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> as allies of the Kurus,
and even the &Ccedil;akas (Scythians) and Pahlavas (Parthians) are
named along with them; Hindu temples are also referred to as well as
Buddhist relic mounds. Thus an extension of the original epic must have
taken place after 300 B.C. and by the beginning of our era.</p>
<p>The Brahmans knew how to utilise the great influence of the old epic
tradition by gradually incorporating didactic matter calculated to
impress upon the people, and especially on kings, the doctrines of the
priestly caste. It thus at last assumed the character of a vast
treatise on duty (<i>dharma</i>), in which the divine origin and
immutability of Brahman institutions, the eternity of the caste system,
and the subordination of all to the priests, are laid down. When the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> attributes its origin to Vy&#257;sa, it
implies a belief in a final redaction, for the name simply means
&ldquo;Arranger.&rdquo; Dahlmann has recently put forward the theory
that the great epic was a didactic work from the very outset; this
view, however, appears to be quite irreconcilable with the data of the
poem, and is not likely to find any support among scholars.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span></p>
<p>What evidence have we as to when the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>
attained to the form in which we possess it? There is an inscription in
a land grant dating from 462 A.D. or at the latest 532 A.D., which
proves incontrovertibly that the epic about 500 A.D. was practically of
exactly the same length as it is stated to have in the survey of
contents (<i>anukrama&#7751;ik&#257;</i>) given in Book I., and as it
actually has now; for it contains the following words: &ldquo;It has
been declared in the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>, the compilation
embracing 100,000 verses, by the highest sage, Vy&#257;sa, the
Vy&#257;sa of the Vedas, the son of Par&#257;&ccedil;ara.&rdquo; This
quotation at the same time proves that the epic at that date included
the very long 12th and 13th, as well as the extensive supplementary
book, the <i>Harivam&#803;&ccedil;a</i>, without any one of which it
would have been impossible to speak even approximately of 100,000
verses. There are also several land grants, dated between 450 and 500
A.D., and found in various parts of India, which quote the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> as an authority teaching the rewards of
pious donors and the punishments of impious despoilers. This shows that
in the middle of the fifth century it already possessed the same
character as at present, that of a Sm&#7771;iti or
Dharma&ccedil;&#257;stra. It is only reasonable to suppose that it had
acquired this character at least a century earlier, or by about 350
A.D. Further research in the writings of the Northern Buddhists and
their dated Chinese translations will probably enable us to put this
date back by some centuries. We are already justified in considering it
likely that the great epic had become a didactic compendium before the
beginning of our era. In any case, the present state of our knowledge
entirely disproves the suggestions put forward by Prof. Holtzmann in
his work on the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>, that the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name="pb288">288</a>]</span>epic
was turned into a Dharma&ccedil;&#257;stra by the Brahmans after 900
A.D., and that whole books were added at this late period.</p>
<p>The literary evidence of Sanskrit authors from about 600 to 1100
A.D. supplies us with a considerable amount of information as to the
state of the great epic during those five centuries. An examination of
the works of B&#257;&#7751;a, and of his predecessor Subandhu, shows
that these authors, who belong to the beginning of the seventh century,
not only studied and made use of legends from every one of the eighteen
books of the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> for the poetical
embellishment of their works, but were even acquainted with the
<i>Harivam&#803;&ccedil;a</i>. We also know that in
B&#257;&#7751;a&rsquo;s time the <i>Bhagavadg&#299;t&#257;</i> was
included in the great epic. The same writer mentions that the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> was recited in the temple of
Mah&#257;k&#257;la at Ujjain. That such recitation was already a
widespread practice at that time is corroborated by an inscription of
about 600 A.D. from the remote Indian colony of Kamboja, which states
that copies of the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>, as well as of the
<i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> and of an unnamed Pur&#257;&#7751;a,
were presented to a temple there, and that the donor had made
arrangements to ensure their daily recitation in perpetuity. This
evidence shows that the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> cannot have been a
mere heroic poem, but must have borne the character of a Sm&#7771;iti
work of long-established authority. Even at the present day both public
and private recitations of the Epics and Pur&#257;&#7751;as are common
in India, and are always instituted for the edification and religious
instruction of worshippers in temples or of members of the family. As a
rule, the Sanskrit texts are not only declaimed, but also explained in
the vernacular tongue for the benefit both of women, and of such males
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name=
"pb289">289</a>]</span>as belong to classes unacquainted with the
learned language of the Brahmans.</p>
<p>We next come to the eminent M&#299;m&#257;m&#803;s&#257; philosopher
<span class="sc">Kum&#257;rila</span>, who has been proved to have
flourished in the first half of the eighth century A.D. In the small
portion of his great commentary, entitled <i>Tantra-v&#257;rttika</i>,
which has been examined, no fewer than ten of the eighteen books of the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> are named, quoted, or referred to. It is
clear that the epic as known to him not only included the first book
(<i>&#257;diparvan</i>), but that that book in his time closely
resembled the form of its text which we possess. It even appears to
have contained the first section, called <i>anukrama&#7751;ik&#257;</i>
or &ldquo;Survey of contents,&rdquo; and the second, entitled
<i>parva-sam&#803;graha</i> or &ldquo;Synopsis of sections.&rdquo;
Kum&#257;rila also knew Books XII. and XIII., which have frequently
been pronounced to be of late origin, as well as XIX. It is evident
from his treatment of the epic that he regarded it as a work of sacred
tradition and of great antiquity, intended from the beginning for the
instruction of all the four castes. To him it is not an account of the
great war between the Kauravas and P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;us; the
descriptions of battles were only used for the purpose of rousing the
martial instincts of the warrior caste.</p>
<p>The great Ved&#257;ntist philosopher &Ccedil;ankar&#257;ch&#257;rya,
who wrote his commentary in 804 A.D., often quotes the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> as a Sm&#7771;iti, and in discussing a
verse from Book XII. expressly states that the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> was intended for the religious instruction
of those classes who by their position are debarred from studying the
Vedas and the Ved&#257;nta.</p>
<p>From the middle of the eleventh century A.D. we have the oldest
known abstract of the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name="pb290">290</a>]</span>the
work of the Kashmirian poet <span class="sc">Kshemendra</span>,
entitled <i>Bh&#257;rata-Manjar&#299;</i>. This condensation is
specially important, because it enables the scholar to determine the
state of the text in detail at that time. Professor B&uuml;hler&rsquo;s
careful comparison of the MSS. of this work with the great epic has led
him to the conclusion that Kshemendra&rsquo;s original did not differ
from the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> as we have it at present in any
other way than two classes of MSS. differ from each other. This
poetical epitome shows several omissions, but these are on the whole of
such a nature as is to be expected in any similar abridgment. It is,
however, likely that twelve chapters (342&ndash;353) of Book XII.,
treating of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, which the abbreviator passes
over, did not exist in the original known to him. There can, moreover,
be no doubt that the forms of several proper names found in the
<i>Manjar&#299;</i> are better and older than those given by the
editions of the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>. Though the division of
the original into eighteen books is found in the abridgment also, it is
made up by turning the third section (<i>gad&#257;-parvan</i>) of Book
IX. (<i>&ccedil;alya-parvan</i>) into a separate book, while combining
Books XII. and XIII. into a single one. This variation probably
represents an old division, as it occurs in many MSS. of the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>.</p>
<p>Another work of importance in determining the state of the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> is a Javanese translation of the epic,
also dating from the eleventh century.</p>
<p>The best-known commentator of the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> is
<span class="sc">N&#299;laka&#7751;&#7789;ha</span>, who lived at
K&#363;rpara, to the west of the God&#257;var&#299;, in
Mah&#257;r&#257;sh&#7789;ra, and, according to Burnell, belongs to the
sixteenth century. Older than N&#299;laka&#7751;&#7789;ha, who quotes
him, is <span class="sc">Arjuna Mi&ccedil;ra</span>, whose commentary,
along with that of N&#299;laka&#7751;&#7789;ha, appears in an edition
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name=
"pb291">291</a>]</span>the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> begun at
Calcutta in 1875. The earliest extant commentator of the great epic is
<span class="sc">Sarvajna N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</span>, large
fragments of whose notes have been preserved, and who cannot have
written later than in the second half of the fourteenth century, but
may be somewhat older.</p>
<p>The main story of the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> in the briefest
possible outline is as follows: In the country of the Bharatas, which,
from the name of the ruling race, had come to be called Kurukshetra, or
&ldquo;Land of the Kurus,&rdquo; there lived at Hastin&#257;pura,
fifty-seven miles north-east of the modern Delhi, two princes named
Dh&#7771;itar&#257;sh&#7789;ra and P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u. The elder of
these brothers being blind, P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u succeeded to the
throne and reigned gloriously. He had five sons called
P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, the chief of whom were Yudhish&#7789;hira,
Bh&#299;ma, and Arjuna. Dh&#7771;itar&#257;sh&#7789;ra had a hundred
sons, usually called Kauravas, or Kuru princes, the most prominent of
whom was Duryodhana. On the premature death of P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u,
Dh&#7771;itar&#257;sh&#7789;ra took over the reins of government, and
receiving his five nephews into his palace, had them brought up with
his own sons. As the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;us distinguished themselves
greatly in feats of arms and helped him to victory, the king appointed
his eldest nephew, Yudhish&#7789;hira, to be heir-apparent. The
P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u princes, however, soon found it necessary to
escape from the plots their cousins now began to set on foot against
them. They made their way to the king of Panch&#257;la, whose daughter
Draupad&#299; was won, in a contest between many kings and heroes, by
Arjuna, who alone was able to bend the king&rsquo;s great bow and to
hit a certain mark. In order to avoid strife, Draupad&#299; consented
to become the common wife of the five princes. At Draupad&#299;&rsquo;s
<i>svayam&#803;vara</i> (public choice of a husband) <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name="pb292">292</a>]</span>the
P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;us made acquaintance with K&#7771;ish&#7751;a, the
hero of the Y&#257;davas, who from this time onward became their fast
friend and adviser. Dh&#7771;itar&#257;sh&#7789;ra, thinking it best to
conciliate the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas in view of their double
alliance with the Panch&#257;las and Y&#257;davas, now divided his
kingdom, giving Hastin&#257;pura to his sons, and to his nephews a
district where they built the city of Indraprastha, the modern Delhi
(i.).</p>
<p>Here the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas ruled wisely and prospered
greatly. Duryodhana&rsquo;s jealousy being aroused, he resolved to ruin
his cousins, with the aid of his uncle &Ccedil;akuni, a skilful
gamester. Dh&#7771;itar&#257;sh&#7789;ra was accordingly induced to
invite the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;us to Hastin&#257;pura. Here
Yudhish&#7789;hira, accepting the challenge to play at dice with
Duryodhana, lost everything, his kingdom, his wealth, his army, his
brothers, and finally Draupad&#299;. In the end a compromise was made
by which the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas agreed to go into banishment for
twelve years, and to remain incognito for a thirteenth, after which
they might return and regain their kingdom (ii.).</p>
<p>With Draupad&#299; they accordingly departed to the K&#257;myaka
forest on the Sarasvat&#299;. The account of their twelve years&rsquo;
life here, and the many legends told to console them in their exile,
constitute the <i>vana-parvan</i> or &ldquo;Forest book,&rdquo; one of
the longest in the poem (iii.).</p>
<p>The thirteenth year they spent in disguise as servants of
Vir&#257;&#7789;a, king of the Matsyas. At this time the Kurus, in
alliance with another king, invaded the country of the Matsyas, causing
much distress. Then the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;us arose, put the enemy to
flight, and restored the king. They now made themselves known, and
entered into an alliance with the king (iv.).</p>
<p>Their message demanding back their possessions <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=
"pb293">293</a>]</span>receiving no answer, they prepared for war. The
rival armies met in the sacred region of Kurukshetra, with numerous
allies on both sides. Joined with the Kurus were, among others, the
people of Kosala, Videha, Anga, Banga (Bengal), Kalinga on the east,
and those of Sindhu, Gandh&#257;ra, Bahl&#299;ka (Balk), together with
the &Ccedil;akas and Yavanas on the west. The P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;us,
on the other hand, were aided by the Panch&#257;las, the Matsyas, part
of the Y&#257;davas under K&#7771;ish&#7751;a, besides the kings of
K&#257;&ccedil;i (Benares), Chedi, Magadha, and others (v.).</p>
<p>The battle raged for eighteen days, till all the Kurus were
destroyed, and only the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas and
K&#7771;ish&#7751;a with his charioteer escaped alive. The account of
it extends over five books (vi.&ndash;x.). Then follows a description
of the obsequies of the dead (xi.). In the next two books, Bh&#299;ma,
the leader of the Kurus, on his deathbed, instructs Yudhish&#7789;hira
for about 20,000 <i>&ccedil;lokas</i> on the duties of kings and other
topics.</p>
<p>The P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;us having been reconciled to the old king
Dh&#7771;itar&#257;sh&#7789;ra, Yudhish&#7789;hira was crowned king in
Hastin&#257;pura, and instituted a great horse-sacrifice (xiv.).
Dh&#7771;itar&#257;sh&#7789;ra having remained at Hastin&#257;pura for
fifteen years, at length retired, with his wife
G&#257;ndh&#257;r&#299;, to the jungle, where they perished in a forest
conflagration (xv.). Among the Y&#257;davas, who had taken different
sides in the great war, an internecine conflict broke out, which
resulted in the annihilation of this people. K&#7771;ish&#7751;a sadly
withdrew to the wilderness, where he was accidentally shot dead by a
hunter (xvi.).</p>
<p>The P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;us themselves, at last weary of life,
leaving the young prince Par&#299;kshit, grandson of Arjuna, to rule
over Hastin&#257;pura, retired to the forest, and dying as they
wandered towards Meru, the mountain of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>gods
(xvii.), ascended to heaven with their faithful spouse (xviii.).</p>
<p>Here the framework of the great epic, which begins at the
commencement of the first book, comes to an end. King Par&#299;kshit
having died of snake-bite, his son Janamejaya instituted a great
sacrifice to the serpents. At that sacrifice the epic was recited by
Vai&ccedil;amp&#257;yana, who had learnt it from Vy&#257;sa. The
latter, we are told, after arranging the four Vedas, composed the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>, which treats of the excellence of the
P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;us, the greatness of K&#7771;ish&#7751;a, and the
wickedness of the sons of Dh&#7771;itar&#257;sh&#7789;ra.</p>
<p>The supplementary book, the <i>Harivam&#803;&ccedil;a</i>, or
&ldquo;Family of Vish&#7751;u,&rdquo; is concerned only with
K&#7771;ish&#7751;a. It contains more than 16,000 <i>&ccedil;lokas</i>,
and is divided into three sections. The first of these describes the
history of K&#7771;ish&#7751;a&rsquo;s ancestors down to the time of
Vish&#7751;u&rsquo;s incarnation in him; the second gives an account of
K&#7771;ish&#7751;a&rsquo;s exploits; the third treats of the future
corruptions of the <i>Kali</i>, or fourth age of the world.</p>
<p>The episodes of the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> are numerous and
often very extensive, constituting, as we have seen, about four-fifths
of the whole poem. Many of them are interesting for various reasons,
and some are distinguished by considerable poetic beauty. One of them,
the story of &Ccedil;akuntal&#257; (occurring in Book I.), supplied
K&#257;lid&#257;sa with the subject of his famous play. Episodes are
specially plentiful in Book III., being related to while away the time
of the exiled P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;us. Here is found the
<i>Matsyop&#257;khy&#257;na</i>, or &ldquo;Episode of the fish,&rdquo;
being the story of the flood, narrated with more diffuseness than the
simple story told in the <i>&Ccedil;atapatha Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>.
The fish here declares itself to be Brahm&#257;, Lord of creatures,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name=
"pb295">295</a>]</span>and not yet Vish&#7751;u, as in the
<i>Bh&#257;gavata Pur&#257;&#7751;a</i>. Manu no longer appears as the
progenitor of mankind, but as a creator who produces all beings and
worlds anew by means of his ascetic power.</p>
<p>Another episode is the history of R&#257;ma, interesting in its
relation to V&#257;lm&#299;ki&rsquo;s <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i>,
which deals with the same subject at much greater length. The myth of
the descent of the Ganges from heaven to earth, here narrated, is told
in the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> also.</p>
<p>Another legend is that of the sage
&#7770;i&ccedil;ya-&ccedil;&#7771;inga, who having produced rain in the
country of Lomap&#257;da, king of the Angas, was rewarded with the hand
of the princess &Ccedil;&#257;nt&#257;, and performed that sacrifice
for King Da&ccedil;aratha which brought about the birth of R&#257;ma.
This episode is peculiarly important from a critical point of view, as
the legend recurs not only in the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i>, but
also in the <i>Padma Pur&#257;&#7751;a</i>, the <i>Skanda
Pur&#257;&#7751;a</i>, and a number of other sources.</p>
<p>Of special interest is the story of King U&ccedil;&#299;nara, son of
&Ccedil;ibi, who sacrificed his life to save a pigeon from a hawk. It
is told again in another part of Book III. about &Ccedil;ibi himself,
as well as in Book XIII. about V&#7771;ishadarbha, son of &Ccedil;ibi.
Distinctly Buddhistic in origin and character, the story is famous in
P&#257;li as well as Sanskrit literature, and spread beyond the limits
of India.</p>
<p>The story of the abduction of Draupad&#299; forms an episode of her
life while she dwelt with the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;us in the
K&#257;myaka forest. Accidentally seen when alone by King Jayadratha of
Sindhu, who was passing with a great army, and fell in love with her at
first sight, she was forcibly carried off, and only rescued after a
terrible fight, in which the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;us annihilated
Jayadratha&rsquo;s host. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href=
"#pb296" name="pb296">296</a>]</span></p>
<p>Interesting as an illustration of the mythological ideas of the age
is the episode which describes the journey of Arjuna to Indra&rsquo;s
heaven. Here we see the mighty warrior-god of the Vedas transformed
into a glorified king of later times, living a life of ease amid the
splendours of his celestial court, where the ear is lulled by strains
of music, while the eye is ravished by the graceful dancing and
exquisite beauty of heavenly nymphs.</p>
<p>In the story of S&#257;vitr&#299; we have one of the finest of the
many ideal female characters which the older epic poetry of India has
created. S&#257;vitr&#299;, daughter of A&ccedil;vapati, king of Madra,
chooses as her husband Satyavat, the handsome and noble son of a blind
and exiled king, who dwells in a forest hermitage. Though warned by the
sage N&#257;rada that the prince is fated to live but a single year,
she persists in her choice, and after the wedding departs with her
husband to his father&rsquo;s forest retreat. Here she lives happily
till she begins to be tortured with anxiety on the approach of the
fatal day. When it arrives, she follows her husband on his way to cut
wood in the forest. After a time he lies down exhausted. Yama, the god
of death, appears, and taking his soul, departs. As S&#257;vitr&#299;
persistently follows him, Yama grants her various boons, always
excepting the life of her husband; but yielding at last to her
importunities, he restores the soul to the lifeless body. Satyavat
recovers, and lives happily for many years with his faithful
S&#257;vitr&#299;.</p>
<p>One of the oldest and most beautiful stories inserted in the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> is the <i>Nalop&#257;khy&#257;na</i>, or
&ldquo;Episode of Nala.&rdquo; It is one of the least corrupted of the
episodes, its great popularity having prevented the transforming hand
of an editor from introducing &Ccedil;iva and Vish&#7751;u, or
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=
"pb297">297</a>]</span>from effacing the simplicity of the manners it
depicts&mdash;the prince, for instance, cooks his own food&mdash;or
from changing the character of Indra, and other old traits. The poem is
pervaded by a high tone of morality, manifested above all in the heroic
devotion and fidelity of Damayant&#299;, its leading character. It also
contains many passages distinguished by tender pathos.</p>
<p>The story is told by the wise B&#7771;ihada&ccedil;va to the exiled
Yudhish&#7789;hira, in order to console him for the loss of the kingdom
he has forfeited at play. Nala, prince of Nishada, chosen from among
many competitors for her hand by Damayant&#299;, princess of Vidarbha,
passes several years of happy married life with her. Then, possessed by
the demon Kali, and indulging in gambling, he loses his kingdom and all
his possessions. Wandering half naked in the forest with
Damayant&#299;, he abandons her in his frenzy. Very pathetic is the
scene describing how he repeatedly returns to the spot where his wife
lies asleep on the ground before he finally deserts her. Equally
touching are the accounts of her terror on awaking to find herself
alone in the forest, and of her lamentations as she roams in search of
her husband, and calls out to him&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">Hero, valiant, knowing duty,</p>
<p class="line xd21e9493">To honour faithful, lord of earth,</p>
<p class="line">If thou art within this forest,</p>
<p class="line xd21e9493">Then show thee in thy proper form.</p>
<p class="line">Shall I hear the voice of Nala,</p>
<p class="line xd21e9493">Sweet as the draught of Am&#7771;ita,</p>
<p class="line">With its deep and gentle accent,</p>

<p class="line">Saying &ldquo;Daughter of Vidarbha!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line xd21e9493">To me with clear and blessed sound.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name=
"pb298">298</a>]</span></p>
<p>There are graphic descriptions of the beauties and terrors of the
tropical forest in which Damayant&#299; wanders. At last she finds her
way back to her father&rsquo;s court at Ku&#7751;&#7693;ina&#803; Many
and striking are the similes with which the poet dwells on the grief
and wasted form of the princess in her separation from her husband. She
is</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">Like the young moon&rsquo;s slender crescent</p>
<p class="line xd21e9493">Obscured by black clouds in the sky;</p>
<p class="line">Like the lotus-flower uprooted,</p>
<p class="line xd21e9493">All parched and withered by the sun;</p>
<p class="line">Like the pallid night, when R&#257;hu</p>
<p class="line xd21e9493">Has swallowed up the darkened moon.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Nala, meanwhile, transformed into a dwarf, has become
charioteer to the king of Oudh. Damayant&#299; at last hears news
leading her to suspect her husband&rsquo;s whereabouts. She accordingly
holds out hopes of her hand to the king of Oudh, on condition of his
driving the distance of 500 miles to Ku&#7751;&#7693;ina in a single
day. Nala, acting as his charioteer, accomplishes the feat, and is
rewarded by the king with the secret of the highest skill in dicing.
Recognised by his wife in spite of his disguise, he regains his true
form. He plays again, and wins back his lost kingdom. Thus after years
of adventure, sorrow, and humiliation he is at last reunited with
Damayant&#299;, with whom he spends the rest of his days in
happiness.</p>
<p>Though several supernatural and miraculous features like those which

<h3 class="main">The Pur&#257;&#7751;as.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Closely connected with the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> is a distinct class of eighteen epic
works, didactic in character and sectarian in purpose, going by the
name of Pur&#257;&#7751;a. The term <i>pur&#257;&#7751;a</i> is already
found in the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as designating cosmogonic inquiries
generally. It is also used in the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> somewhat
vaguely to express &ldquo;ancient legendary lore,&rdquo; implying
didactic as well as narrative matter, and pointing to an old collection
of epic stories. One passage of the epic (I. v. 1) describes
<i>pur&#257;&#7751;a</i> as containing stories of the gods and
genealogies of the sages. In Book XVIII., as well as in the
<i>Harivam&#803;&ccedil;a</i>, mention is even made of eighteen
Pur&#257;&#7751;as, which, however, have not been preserved; for those
known to us are all, on the whole, later than the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>, and for the most part derive their
legends of ancient days from the great epic itself. Nevertheless they
contain much that is old; and it is not always possible to assume that
the passages they have in common with the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>
and <i>Manu</i> have been borrowed from those works. They are connected
by many threads with the old law-books (<i>sm&#7771;itis</i>) and the
Vedas, representing probably a development of older works of the same
class. In that part of their contents which is peculiar to them, the
Pur&#257;&#7751;as agree so closely, being often verbally identical for
pages, that they must be derived from some older collection as a common
source. Most of them are introduced in exactly the same way as the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>, Ugra&ccedil;ravas, the son of
Lomaharsha&#7751;a, being represented as relating their contents to
&Ccedil;aunaka on the occasion of a sacrifice in the Naimisha forest.
The object of most of these legendary compilations <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name="pb300">300</a>]</span>is
to recommend the sectarian cult of Vish&#7751;u, though some of them
favour the worship of &Ccedil;iva.</p>
<p>Besides cosmogony, they deal with mythical descriptions of the
earth, the doctrine of the cosmic ages, the exploits of ancient gods,
saints, and heroes, accounts of the Avat&#257;rs of Vish&#7751;u, the
genealogies of the Solar and Lunar race of kings, and enumerations of
the thousand names of Vish&#7751;u or of &Ccedil;iva. They also contain
rules about the worship of the gods by means of prayers, fastings,
votive offerings, festivals, and pilgrimages.</p>
<p>The <i>Garu&#7693;a</i>, as well as the late and unimportant <i>Agni
Pur&#257;&#7751;a</i>, practically constitute abstracts of the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> and the <i>Harivam&#803;&ccedil;a</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>V&#257;yu</i>, which appears to be one of the oldest,
coincides in part of its matter with the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>,
but is more closely connected with the <i>Harivam&#803;&ccedil;a</i>,
the passage which deals with the creation of the world often agreeing
verbatim with the corresponding part of the latter poem.</p>
<p>The relationship of the <i>Matsya Pur&#257;&#7751;a</i> to the great
epic and its supplementary book as sources is similarly intimate. It is
introduced with the story of Manu and the Fish (<i>Matsya</i>). The
<i>K&#363;rma</i>, besides giving an account of the various
Avat&#257;rs of Vish&#7751;u (of which the tortoise or
<i>k&#363;rma</i> is one), of the genealogies of gods and kings, as
well as other matters, contains an extensive account of the world in
accordance with the accepted cosmological notions of the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> and of the Pur&#257;&#7751;as in general.
The world is here represented as consisting of seven concentric islands
separated by different oceans. The central island, with Mount Meru in
the middle, is <i>Jambu-dv&#299;pa</i>, of which
<i>Bh&#257;rata-varsha</i>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href=
"#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span>the &ldquo;kingdom of the
Bharatas,&rdquo; or India, is the main division.</p>
<p>The <i>M&#257;rka&#7751;&#7693;eya</i>, which expressly recognises
the priority of the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>, is so called because
it is related by the sage M&#257;rka&#7751;&#7693;eya to explain
difficulties suggested by the epic, such as, How could
K&#7771;ish&#7751;a become a man? Its leading feature is narrative and
it is the least sectarian of the Pur&#257;&#7751;as.</p>
<p>The extensive <i>Padma Pur&#257;&#7751;a</i>, which contains a great
many stones agreeing with those of the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>,
is, on the other hand, strongly Vishnuite in tone. Yet this, as well as
the <i>M&#257;rka&#7751;&#7693;eya</i>, expressly states the doctrine
of the <i>Tri-m&#363;rti</i> or Trinity, that Brahm&#257;,
Vish&#7751;u, and &Ccedil;iva are only one being. This doctrine,
already to be found in the <i>Harivam&#803;&ccedil;a</i>, is not so
prominent in post-Vedic literature as is commonly supposed. It is
interesting to note that the story of R&#257;ma, as told in the
<i>Padma Pur&#257;&#7751;a</i>, follows not only the
<i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> but also K&#257;lid&#257;sa&rsquo;s
account in the <i>Raghuvam&#803;&ccedil;a</i>, with which it often
agrees literally. Again, the story of &Ccedil;akuntal&#257; is related,
not in accordance with the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>, but with
K&#257;lid&#257;sa&rsquo;s drama.</p>
<p>The <i>Brahma-vaivarta Pur&#257;&#7751;a</i> is also strongly
sectarian in favour of Vish&#7751;u in the form of K&#7771;ish&#7751;a.
It is to be noted that both here and in the <i>Padma
Pur&#257;&#7751;a</i> an important part is played by
K&#7771;ish&#7751;a&rsquo;s mistress R&#257;dh&#257;, who is unknown to
the <i>Harivam&#803;&ccedil;a</i>, the <i>Vish&#7751;u</i>, and even
the <i>Bh&#257;gavata Pur&#257;&#7751;a</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Vish&#7751;u Pur&#257;&#7751;a</i>, which very often agrees
with the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> in its subject-matter,
corresponds most closely to the Indian definition of a
Pur&#257;&#7751;a, as treating of the five topics of primary creation,
secondary creation, genealogies of gods and patriarchs, reigns of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302" name=
"pb302">302</a>]</span>various Manus, and the history of the old
dynasties of kings.</p>
<p>The <i>Bh&#257;gavata Pur&#257;&#7751;a</i>, which consists of about
18,000 &ccedil;lokas, derives its name from being dedicated to the
glorification of Bh&#257;gavata or Vish&#7751;u. It is later than the
<i>Vish&#7751;u</i>, which it presupposes, probably dating from the
thirteenth century. It exercises a more powerful influence in India
than any other Pur&#257;&#7751;a. The most popular part is the tenth
book, which narrates in detail the history of K&#7771;ish&#7751;a, and
has been translated into perhaps every one of the vernacular languages
of India.</p>
<p>Other Vishnuite Pur&#257;&#7751;as of a late date are the
<i>Brahma</i>, the <i>N&#257;rad&#299;ya</i>, the <i>V&#257;mana</i>,
and the <i>Var&#257;ha</i>, the latter two called after the Dwarf and
the Boar incarnations of Vish&#7751;u.</p>
<p>Those which specially favour the cult of &Ccedil;iva are the
<i>Skanda</i>, the <i>&Ccedil;iva</i>, the <i>Linga</i>, and the
<i>Bhavishya</i> or <i>Bhavishyat Pur&#257;&#7751;as</i>. The latter
two contain little narrative matter, being rather ritual in character.
A <i>Bhavishyat Pur&#257;&#7751;a</i> is already mentioned in the
<i>&#256;pastamba Dharma S&#363;tra</i>.</p>
<p>Besides these eighteen Pur&#257;&#7751;as there is also an equal
number of secondary works of the same class called
<i>Upa-pur&#257;&#7751;as</i>, in which the epic matter has become
entirely subordinate to the ritual element.</p>

<h3 class="main">The R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Though there is, as we shall see, good reason for
supposing that the original part of the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i>
assumed shape at a time when the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> was still
in a state of flux, we have deferred describing it on account of its
connection with the subsequent development of epic poetry in Sanskrit
literature. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name=
"pb303">303</a>]</span></p>
<p>In its present form the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> consists of
about 24,000 <i>&ccedil;lokas</i>, and is divided into seven books. It
has been preserved in three distinct recensions, the West Indian (A),
the Bengal (B), and the Bombay (C). About one-third of the
<i>&ccedil;lokas</i> in each recension occurs in neither of the other
two. The Bombay recension has in most cases preserved the oldest form
of the text; for, as the other two arose in the centres of classical
Sanskrit literature, where the <i>Gau&#7693;a</i> and the
<i>Vaidarbha</i> styles of composition respectively flourished, the
irregularities of the epic language have been removed in them. The
<i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> was here treated as a regular
k&#257;vya or artificial epic, a fate which the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> escaped because it early lost its original
character, and came to be regarded as a didactic work. These two later
recensions must not, however, be looked upon as mere revisions of the
Bombay text. The variations of all three are of such a kind that they
can for the most part be accounted for only by the fluctuations of oral
tradition among the professional reciters of the epic, at the time when
the three recensions assumed definite shape in different parts of the
country by being committed to writing. After having been thus fixed,
the fate of each of these recensions was of course similar to that of
any other text. They appear to go back to comparatively early times.
For quotations from the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> occurring in
works that belong to the eighth and ninth centuries A.D. show that a
recension allied to the present C, and probably another allied to the
present A, existed at that period. Moreover, Kshemendra&rsquo;s
poetical abstract of the epic, the
<i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a-kath&#257;s&#257;ra-manjar&#299;</i>, which
follows the contents of the original step by step, proves that its
author used A, and perhaps B also, in the middle of the eleventh
century. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name=
"pb304">304</a>]</span>Bhoja, the composer of another epitome, the
<i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a-champ&#363;</i>, probably used C in the
same century.</p>
<p>The careful investigations of Professor <span class=
"sc">Jacobi</span> have shown that the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i>
originally consisted of five books only (ii.&ndash;vi.). The seventh is
undoubtedly a later addition, for the conclusion of the sixth was
evidently at one time the end of the whole poem. Again, the first book
has several passages which conflict with statements in the later books.
It further contains two tables of contents (in cantos i. and iii.)
which were clearly made at different times; for one of them takes no
notice of the first and last books, and must, therefore, have been made
before these were added. What was obviously a part of the commencement
of the original poem has been separated from its continuation at the
opening of Book II., and now forms the beginning of the fifth canto of
Book I. Some cantos have also been interpolated in the genuine books.
As Professor Jacobi shows, all these additions to the original body of
the epic have been for the most part so loosely attached that the
junctures are easy to recognise. They are, however, pervaded by the
same spirit as the older part. There is, therefore, no reason for the
supposition that they are due to a Brahman revision intended to
transform a poem originally meant for the warrior caste. They seem
rather to owe their origin simply to the desire of professional
rhapsodists to meet the demands of the popular taste. We are told in
the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> itself that the poem was either
recited by professional minstrels or sung to the accompaniment of a
stringed instrument, being handed down orally, in the first place by
R&#257;ma&rsquo;s two sons Ku&ccedil;a and Lava. These names are
nothing more than the inventions of popular etymology meant to explain
the Sanskrit word <i>ku&ccedil;&#299;lava</i>, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name=
"pb305">305</a>]</span>&ldquo;bard&rdquo; or &ldquo;actor.&rdquo; The
new parts were incorporated before the three recensions which have come
down to us arose, but a considerable time must have elapsed between the
composition of the original poem and that of the additions. For the
tribal hero of the former has in the latter been transformed into a
national hero, the moral ideal of the people; and the human hero (like
K&#7771;ish&#7751;a in the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>) of the five
genuine books (excepting a few interpolations) has in the first and
last become deified and identified with the god Vish&#7751;u, his
divine nature in these additions being always present to the minds of
their authors. Here, too, <span class="sc">V&#257;lm&#299;ki</span>,
the composer of the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i>, appears as a
contemporary of R&#257;ma, and is already regarded as a seer. A long
interval of time must have been necessary for such transformations as
these.</p>
<p>As to the place of its origin, there is good reason for believing
that the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> arose in Kosala, the country
ruled by the race of Ikshv&#257;ku in Ayodhy&#257; (Oudh). For we are
told in the seventh book (canto 45) that the hermitage of
V&#257;lm&#299;ki lay on the south bank of the Ganges; the poet must
further have been connected with the royal house of Ayodhy&#257;, as
the banished S&#299;t&#257; took refuge in his hermitage, where her
twin sons were born, brought up, and later learnt the epic from his
lips; and lastly, the statement is made in the first book (canto 5)
that the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> arose in the family of the
Ikshv&#257;kus. In Ayodhy&#257;, then, there must have been current
among the court bards (<i>s&#363;ta</i>) a number of epic tales
narrating the fortunes of the Ikshv&#257;ku hero R&#257;ma. Such
legends, we may assume, V&#257;lm&#299;ki worked up into a single
homogeneous production, which, as the earliest epic of importance
conforming to the rules of poetics, justly received <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name="pb306">306</a>]</span>the
name of <i>&#257;di-k&#257;vya</i>, or &ldquo;first artificial
poem,&rdquo; from its author&rsquo;s successors. This work was then
learnt by professional rhapsodists (<i>ku&ccedil;&#299;lava</i>) and
recited by them in public as they wandered about the country.</p>
<p>The original part of the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> appears to
have been completed at a time when the epic kernel of the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> had not as yet assumed definite shape. For
while the heroes of the latter are not mentioned in the
<i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i>, the story of R&#257;ma is often
referred to in the longer epic. Again, in a passage of Book VII. of the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>, which cannot be regarded as a later
addition, two lines are quoted as V&#257;lm&#299;ki&rsquo;s that occur
unaltered in Book VI. of the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i>. The poem
of V&#257;lm&#299;ki must, therefore, have been generally known as an
old work before the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> assumed a coherent
form. In Book III. (cantos 277&ndash;291) of the latter epic, moreover,
there is a <i>R&#257;mop&#257;khy&#257;na</i> or &ldquo;Episode of
R&#257;ma,&rdquo; which seems to be based on the
<i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> as it contains several verses agreeing
more or less with V&#257;lm&#299;ki&rsquo;s lines, and its author
presupposes on the part of his audience a knowledge of the
<i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> as represented by the Bombay
recension.</p>
<p>A further question of importance in determining the age of the
<i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> is its relation to Buddhistic
literature. Now, the story of R&#257;ma is found in a somewhat altered
form in one of the P&#257;li Birth-Stories, the <i>Da&ccedil;aratha
J&#257;taka</i>. As this version confines itself to the first part of
R&#257;ma&rsquo;s adventures, his sojourn in the forest, it might at
first sight seem to be the older of the two. There is, however, at
least an indication that the second part of the story, the expedition
to Lank&#257;, was also known to the author of the <i>J&#257;taka</i>;
for while V&#257;lm&#299;ki&rsquo;s poem concludes with the reunion of
R&#257;ma and S&#299;t&#257;, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307"
href="#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span><i>J&#257;taka</i> is made to
end with the marriage of the couple after the manner of fairy tales,
there being at the same time traces that they were wedded all along in
the original source of the legend. Moreover, a verse from the old part
of the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> (vi. 128) actually occurs in a
P&#257;li form embedded in the prose of this <i>J&#257;taka</i>.</p>
<p>It might, indeed, be inferred from the greater freedom with which
they handle the <i>&ccedil;loka</i> metre that the canonical Buddhistic
writings are older than the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i>, in which
the <i>&ccedil;loka</i> is of the classical Sanskrit type. But, as a
matter of fact, these P&#257;li works on the whole observe the laws of
the classical <i>&ccedil;loka</i>, their metrical irregularities being
most probably caused by the recent application of P&#257;li to literary
purposes as well as by the inferior preservation of P&#257;li works. On
the other hand, Buddhistic literature early made use of the
<i>&#256;ry&#257;</i> metre, which, though so popular in classical
Sanskrit poetry, is not yet to be found in the Sanskrit epics.</p>
<p>The only mention of Buddha in the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i>
occurs in a passage which is evidently interpolated. Hence the balance
of the evidence in relation to Buddhism seems to favour the
pre-Buddhistic origin of the genuine
<i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i>.</p>
<p>The question whether the Greeks were known to the author of our epic
is, of course, also of chronological moment. An examination of the poem
shows that the Yavanas (Greeks) are only mentioned twice, once in Book
I. and once in a canto of Book IV., which Professor Jacobi shows to be
an interpolation. The only conclusion to be drawn from this is that the
additions to the original poem were made some time after 300 B.C.
Professor Weber&rsquo;s assumption of Greek influence in the story of
the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> seems to lack foundation.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308" name=
"pb308">308</a>]</span>For the tale of the abduction of S&#299;t&#257;
and the expedition to Lank&#257; for her recovery has no real
correspondence with that of the rape of Helen and the Trojan war. Nor
is there any sufficient reason to suppose that the account of R&#257;ma
bending a powerful bow in order to win S&#299;t&#257; was borrowed from
the adventures of Ulysses. Stories of similar feats of strength for a
like object are to be found in the poetry of other nations besides the
Greeks, and could easily have arisen independently.</p>
<p>The political aspect of Eastern India as revealed by the
<i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> sheds some additional light on the age
of the epic. In the first place, no mention is made of the city of
P&#257;&#7789;aliputra (Patna), which was founded by King
K&#257;l&#257;&ccedil;oka (under whom the second Buddhist council was
held at Vai&ccedil;&#257;l&#299; about 380 B.C.), and which by the time
of Megasthenes (300 B.C.) had become the capital of India. Yet
R&#257;ma is in Book I. (canto 35) described as passing the very spot
where that city stood, and the poet makes a point (in cantos
32&ndash;33) of referring to the foundation of a number of cities in
Eastern Hindustan, such as Kau&ccedil;&#257;mb&#299;, K&#257;nyakubja,
and K&#257;mpilya, in order to show how far the fame of the
<i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> spread beyond the confines of Kosala,
the land of its origin. Had P&#257;&#7789;aliputra existed at the time,
it could not have failed to be mentioned.</p>
<p>It is further a noteworthy fact that the capital of Kosala is in the
original <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> regularly called Ayodhy&#257;,
while the Buddhists, Jains, Greeks, and Patanjali always give it the
name of S&#257;keta. Now in the last book of the
<i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> we are told that R&#257;ma&rsquo;s son,
Lava, fixed the seat of his government at &Ccedil;r&#257;vast&#299;, a
city not mentioned at all in the old part of the epic; and in
Buddha&rsquo;s time King Prasenajit of Kosala is known to have
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name=
"pb309">309</a>]</span>reigned at &Ccedil;r&#257;vast&#299;. All this
points to the conclusion that the original
<i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> was composed when the ancient
Ayodhy&#257; had not yet been deserted, but was still the chief city of
Kosala, when its new name of S&#257;keta was still unknown, and before
the seat of government was transferred to
&Ccedil;r&#257;vast&#299;.</p>
<p>Again, in the old part of Book I., Mithil&#257; and
Vi&ccedil;&#257;l&#257; are spoken of as twin cities under separate
rulers, while we know that by Buddha&rsquo;s time they had coalesced to
the famous city of Vai&ccedil;&#257;l&#299;, which was then ruled by an
oligarchy.</p>
<p>The political conditions described in the
<i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> indicate the patriarchal rule of kings
possessing only a small territory, and never point to the existence of
more complex states; while the references of the poets of the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> to the dominions in Eastern India ruled by
a powerful king, Jar&#257;sandha, and embracing many lands besides
Magadha, reflect the political conditions of the fourth century B.C.
The cumulative evidence of the above arguments makes it difficult to
avoid the conclusion that the kernel of the
<i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> was composed before 500 B.C., while the
more recent portions were probably not added till the second century
B.C. and later.</p>
<p>This conclusion does not at first sight seem to be borne out by the
linguistic evidence of the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i>, For the
epic (<i>&#257;rsha</i>) dialect of the Bombay recension, which is
practically the same as that of the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>, both
betrays a stage of development decidedly later than that of
P&#257;&#7751;ini, and is taken no notice of by that grammarian. But it
is, for all that, not necessarily later in date. For P&#257;&#7751;ini
deals only with the refined Sanskrit of the cultured
(<i>&ccedil;ish&#7789;a</i>), that is to say, of the Brahmans,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name=
"pb310">310</a>]</span>which would be more archaic than the popular
dialect of wandering rhapsodists; and he would naturally have ignored
the latter. Now at the time of the A&ccedil;oka inscriptions, or hardly
more than half a century later than P&#257;&#7751;ini, Pr&#257;krit was
the language of the people in the part of India where the
<i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> was composed. It is, therefore, not at
all likely that the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i>, which aimed at
popularity, should have been composed as late as the time of
P&#257;&#7751;ini, when it could not have been generally understood. If
the language of the epic is later than P&#257;&#7751;ini, it is
difficult to see how it escaped the dominating influence of his
grammar. It is more likely that the popular Sanskrit of the epics
received general currency at a much earlier date by the composition of
a poem like that of V&#257;lm&#299;ki. A searching comparative
investigation of the classical K&#257;vyas will probably show that they
are linguistically more closely connected with the old epic poetry, and
that they deviate more from the P&#257;&#7751;inean standard than is
usually supposed.</p>
<p>In style the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> is already far removed
from the na&iuml;ve popular epic, in which the story is the chief
thing, and not its form. V&#257;lm&#299;ki is rich in similes, which he
often cumulates; he not infrequently uses the cognate figure called
<i>r&#363;paka</i> or &ldquo;identification&rdquo; (<i>e.g.</i>
&ldquo;foot-lotus&rdquo;) with much skill, and also occasionally
employs other ornaments familiar to the classical poets, besides
approximating to them in the style of his descriptions. The
<i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i>, in fact, represents the dawn of the
later artificial poetry <i>(k&#257;vya)</i>, which was in all
probability the direct continuation and development of the art handed
down by the rhapsodists who recited V&#257;lm&#299;ki&rsquo;s work.
Such a relationship is distinctly recognised by the authors
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311" name=
"pb311">311</a>]</span>of the great classical epics (mah&#257;kavis)
when they refer to him as the <i>&#257;di-kavi</i> or &ldquo;first
poet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The story of the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i>, as narrated in the
five genuine books, consists of two distinct parts. The first describes
the events at the court of King Da&ccedil;aratha at Ayodhy&#257; and
their consequences. Here we have a purely human and natural account of
the intrigues of a queen to set her son upon the throne. There is
nothing fantastic in the narrative, nor has it any mythological
background. If the epic ended with the return of R&#257;ma&rsquo;s
brother, Bharata, to the capital, after the old king&rsquo;s death, it
might pass for a historical saga. For Ikshv&#257;ku, Da&ccedil;aratha,
and R&#257;ma are the names of celebrated and mighty kings, mentioned
even in the <i>Rigveda</i>, though not there connected with one another
in any way.</p>
<p>The character of the second part is entirely different. Based on a
foundation of myths, it is full of the marvellous and fantastic. The
oldest theory as to the significance of the story was that of Lassen,
who held that it was intended to represent allegorically the first
attempt of the Aryans to conquer the South. But R&#257;ma is nowhere
described as founding an Aryan realm in the Dekhan, nor is any such
intention on his part indicated anywhere in the epic. Weber
subsequently expressed the same view in a somewhat modified form.
According to him, the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> was meant to
account for the spread of Aryan culture to the South and to Ceylon. But
this form of the allegorical theory also lacks any confirmation from
the statements of the epic itself; for R&#257;ma&rsquo;s expedition is
nowhere represented as producing any change or improvement in the
civilisation of the South. The poet knows nothing about the Dekhan
beyond the fact that Brahman hermitages are to be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name=
"pb312">312</a>]</span>found there. Otherwise it is a region haunted by
the monsters and fabulous beings with which an Indian imagination would
people an unknown land.</p>
<p>There is much more probability in the opinion of Jacobi, that the
<i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> contains no allegory at all, but is
based on Indian mythology. The foundation of the second part would thus
be a celestial myth of the Veda transformed into a narrative of earthly
adventures according to a not uncommon development. S&#299;t&#257;, can
be traced to the <i>Rigveda</i>, where she appears as the Furrow
personified and invoked as a goddess. In some of the G&#7771;ihya
S&#363;tras she again appears as a genius of the ploughed field, is
praised as a being of great beauty, and is accounted the wife of Indra
or Parjanya, the rain-god. There are traces of this origin in the
<i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> itself. For S&#299;t&#257; is
represented (i. 66) as having emerged from the earth when her father
Janaka was once ploughing, and at last she disappears underground in
the arms of the goddess Earth (vii. 97). Her husband, R&#257;ma, would
be no other than Indra, and his conflict with R&#257;va&#7751;a, chief
of the demons, would represent the Indra-V&#7771;itra myth of the
<i>Rigveda</i>. This identification is confirmed by the name of
R&#257;va&#7751;a&rsquo;s son being Indrajit, &ldquo;Conqueror of
Indra,&rdquo; or Indra&ccedil;atru, &ldquo;Foe of Indra,&rdquo; the
latter being actually an epithet of V&#7771;itra in the <i>Rigveda</i>.
R&#257;va&#7751;a&rsquo;s most notable feat, the rape of
S&#299;t&#257;, has its prototype in the stealing of the cows recovered
by Indra. Hanumat, the chief of the monkeys and R&#257;ma&rsquo;s ally
in the recovery of S&#299;t&#257;, is the son of the wind-god, with the
patronymic M&#257;ruti, and is described as flying hundreds of leagues
through the air to find S&#299;t&#257;. Hence in his figure perhaps
survives a reminiscence of Indra&rsquo;s alliance with the Maruts in
his conflict with V&#7771;itra, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb313" href="#pb313" name="pb313">313</a>]</span>of the dog
Saram&#257;, who, as Indra&rsquo;s messenger, crosses the waters of the
Ras&#257; and tracks the cows. Saram&#257; recurs as the name of a
demoness who consoles S&#299;t&#257; in her captivity. The name of
Hanumat being Sanskrit, the character is probably not borrowed from the
aborigines. As Hanumat is at the present day the tutelary deity of
village settlements all over India, Prof. Jacobi&rsquo;s surmise that
he must have been connected with agriculture, and may have been a
genius of the monsoon, has some probability.</p>
<p>The main story of the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> begins with an
account of the city of Ayodhy&#257; under the rule of the mighty King
Da&ccedil;aratha, the sons of whose three wives, Kau&ccedil;aly&#257;,
Kaikey&#299;, and Sumitr&#257;, are R&#257;ma, Bharata, and
Lakshma&#7751;a respectively. R&#257;ma is married to S&#299;t&#257;,
daughter of Janaka, king of Videha. Da&ccedil;aratha, feeling the
approach of old age, one day announces in a great assembly that he
desires to make R&#257;ma heir-apparent, an announcement received with
general rejoicing because of R&#257;ma&rsquo;s great popularity.
Kaikey&#299;, meanwhile, wishing her son Bharata to succeed, reminds
the king that he had once offered her the choice of two boons, of which
she had as yet not availed herself. When Da&ccedil;aratha at last
promises to fulfil whatever she may desire, Kaikey&#299; requests him
to appoint Bharata his successor, and to banish R&#257;ma for fourteen
years. The king, having in vain implored her to retract, passes a
sleepless night. Next day, when the solemn consecration of R&#257;ma is
to take place, Da&ccedil;aratha sends for his son and informs him of
his fate. R&#257;ma receives the news calmly and prepares to obey his
father&rsquo;s command as his highest duty. S&#299;t&#257; and
Lakshma&#7751;a resolve on sharing his fortunes, and accompany him in
his exile. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314" name=
"pb314">314</a>]</span>The aged king, overcome with grief at parting
from his son, withdraws from Kaikey&#299;, and passing the remainder of
his days with R&#257;ma&rsquo;s mother, Kau&ccedil;aly&#257;, finally
dies lamenting for his banished son. R&#257;ma has meanwhile lived
peacefully and happily with S&#299;t&#257; and his brother in the wild
forest of Da&#7751;&#7693;aka. On the death of the old king, Bharata,
who in the interval has lived with the parents of his mother, is
summoned to the throne. Refusing the succession with noble indignation,
he sets out for the forest in order to bring R&#257;ma back to
Ayodhy&#257;. R&#257;ma, though much moved by his brother&rsquo;s
request, declines to return because he must fulfil his vow of exile.
Taking off his gold-embroidered shoes, he gives them to Bharata as a
sign that he hands over his inheritance to him. Bharata returning to
Ayodhy&#257;, places R&#257;ma&rsquo;s shoes on the throne, and keeping
the royal umbrella over them, holds council and dispenses justice by
their side.</p>
<p>R&#257;ma now sets about the task of combating the formidable giants
that infest the Da&#7751;&#7693;aka forest and are a terror to the
pious hermits settled there. Having, by the advice of the sage Agastya,
procured the weapons of Indra, he begins a successful conflict, in
which he slays many thousands of demons. Their chief,
R&#257;va&#7751;a, enraged and determined on revenge, turns one of his
followers into a golden deer, which appears to S&#299;t&#257;. While
R&#257;ma and Lakshma&#7751;a are engaged, at her request, in pursuit
of it, R&#257;va&#7751;a in the guise of an ascetic approaches
S&#299;t&#257;, carries her off by force, and wounds the vulture
Ja&#7789;&#257;yu, which guards her abode. R&#257;ma on his return is
seized with grief and despair; but, as he is burning the remains of the
vulture, a voice from the pyre proclaims to him how he can conquer his
foes and recover his wife. He now proceeds to conclude <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name="pb315">315</a>]</span>a
solemn alliance with the chiefs of the monkeys, Hanumat and
Sugr&#299;va. With the help of the latter, R&#257;ma slays the terrible
giant Bali. Hanumat meanwhile crosses from the mainland to the island
of Lank&#257;, the abode of R&#257;va&#7751;a, in search of
S&#299;t&#257;. Here he finds her wandering sadly in a grove and
announces to her that deliverance is at hand. After slaying a number of
demons, he returns and reports his discovery to R&#257;ma. A plan of
campaign is now arranged. The monkeys having miraculously built a
bridge from the continent to Lank&#257; with the aid of the god of the
sea, R&#257;ma leads his army across, slays R&#257;va&#7751;a, and wins
back S&#299;t&#257;. After she has purified herself from the suspicion
of infidelity by the ordeal of fire, R&#257;ma joyfully returns with
her to Ayodhy&#257;, where he reigns gloriously in association with his
faithful brother Bharata, and gladdens his subjects with a new golden
age.</p>
<p>Such in bare outline is the main story of the
<i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i>. By the addition of the first and last
books V&#257;lm&#299;ki&rsquo;s epic has in the following way been
transformed into a poem meant to glorify the god Vish&#7751;u.
R&#257;va&#7751;a, having obtained from Brahm&#257; the boon of being
invulnerable to gods, demigods, and demons, abuses his immunity in so
terrible a manner that the gods are reduced to despair. Bethinking
themselves at last that R&#257;va&#7751;a had in his arrogance
forgotten to ask that he should not be wounded by men, they implore
Vish&#7751;u to allow himself to be born as a man for the destruction
of the demon. Vish&#7751;u, consenting, is born as R&#257;ma, and
accomplishes the task. At the end of the seventh book Brahm&#257; and
the other gods come to R&#257;ma, pay homage to him, and proclaim that
he is really Vish&#7751;u, &ldquo;the glorious lord of the
discus.&rdquo; The belief here expressed <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb316" href="#pb316" name="pb316">316</a>]</span>that R&#257;ma is an
incarnation of Vish&#7751;u, the highest god, has secured to the hero
of our epic the worship of the Hindus down to the present day. That
belief, forming the fundamental doctrine of the religious system of
R&#257;m&#257;nuja in the twelfth and of R&#257;m&#257;nanda in the
fourteenth century, has done much to counteract the spread of the
degrading superstitions and impurities of &Ccedil;ivaism both in the
South and in the North of India.</p>
<p>The <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> contains several interesting
episodes, though, of course, far fewer than the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>. One of them, a thoroughly Indian story,
full of exaggerations and impossibilities, is the legend, told in Book
I., of the descent of the Ganges. It relates how the sacred river was
brought down from heaven to earth in order to purify the remains of the
60,000 sons of King Sagara, who were reduced to ashes by the sage
Kapila when his devotions were disturbed by them.</p>
<p>Another episode (i. 52&ndash;65) is that of Vi&ccedil;v&#257;mitra,
a powerful king, who comes into conflict with the great sage
Vasish&#7789;ha by endeavouring to take away his miraculous cow by
force. Vi&ccedil;v&#257;mitra then engages in mighty penances, in which
he resists the seductions of beautiful nymphs, and which extend over
thousands of years, till he finally attains Brahmanhood, and is
reconciled with his rival, Vasish&#7789;ha.</p>
<p>The short episode which relates the origin of the
<i>&ccedil;loka</i> metre is one of the most attractive and poetical.
V&#257;lm&#299;ki in his forest hermitage is preparing to describe
worthily the fortunes of R&#257;ma. While he is watching a fond pair of
birds on the bank of the river, the male is suddenly shot by a hunter,
and falls dead on the ground, weltering in his blood.
V&#257;lm&#299;ki, deeply touched by the grief of the bereaved female,
involuntarily utters <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href="#pb317"
name="pb317">317</a>]</span>words lamenting the death of her mate and
threatening vengeance on the wicked murderer. But, strange to tell, his
utterance is no ordinary speech and flows in a melodious stream. As he
wanders, lost in thought, towards his hut, Brahm&#257; appears and
announces to the poet that he has unconsciously created the rhythm of
the <i>&ccedil;loka</i> metre. The deity then bids him compose in this
measure the divine poem on the life and deeds of R&#257;ma. This story
may have a historical significance, for it indicates with some
probability that the classical form of the <i>&ccedil;loka</i> was
first fixed by V&#257;lm&#299;ki, the author of the original part of
the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i>.</p>
<p>The epic contains the following verse foretelling its everlasting
fame:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">As long as mountain ranges stand</p>
<p class="line">And rivers flow upon the earth:</p>
<p class="line">So long will this R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</p>
<p class="line">Survive upon the lips of men.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">This prophecy has been perhaps even more abundantly
fulfilled than the well-known prediction of Horace. No product of
Sanskrit literature has enjoyed a greater popularity in India down to
the present day than the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i>. Its story
furnishes the subject of many other Sanskrit poems as well as plays,
and still delights, from the lips of reciters, the hearts of myriads of
the Indian people, as at the great annual R&#257;ma festival held at
Benares. It has been translated into many Indian vernaculars. Above
all, it inspired the greatest poet of medi&aelig;val Hindustan,
Tuls&#299; D&#257;s, to compose in Hind&#299; his version of the epic
entitled <i>R&#257;m Charit M&#257;nas</i>, which, with its ideal
standard of virtue and purity, is a kind of bible to a hundred millions
of the people of Northern India. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318"

<h2 class="main">K&#257;vya or Court Epic</h2>
<h2 class="sub">(<i>Circa</i> 200 B.C.&ndash;1100 A.D.)</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The real history of the K&#257;vya, or artificial epic
poetry of India, does not begin till the first half of the seventh
century A.D., with the reign of King Harsha-vardhana of
Th&#257;ne&ccedil;ar and Kanauj (606&ndash;648), who ruled over the
whole of Northern India, and under whose patronage B&#257;&#7751;a
wrote his historical romance, <i>Harsha-charita</i>, and other works.
The date of no K&#257;vya before this landmark has as yet been fixed
with certainty. One work, however, which is dominated by the K&#257;vya
style, the <i>B&#7771;ihatsam&#803;hit&#257;</i> of the astronomer
Var&#257;hamihira, can without hesitation be assigned to the middle of
the sixth century. But as to the date of the most famous classical
poets, K&#257;lid&#257;sa, Subandhu, Bh&#257;ravi,
Gu&#7751;&#257;&#7693;hya, and others, we have no historical authority.
The most definite statement that can be made about them is that their
fame was widely diffused by about 600 A.D., as is attested by the way
in which their names are mentioned in B&#257;&#7751;a and in an
inscription of 634 A.D. Some of them, moreover, like
Gu&#7751;&#257;&#7693;hya, to whose work Subandhu repeatedly alludes,
must certainly belong to a much earlier time. The scanty materials
supplied by the poets themselves, which might help to determine their
dates, are difficult to utilise, because the history of India, both
political and social, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href=
"#pb319" name="pb319">319</a>]</span>during the first five centuries of
our era, is still involved in obscurity.</p>
<p>With regard to the age of court poetry in general, we have the
important literary evidence of the quotations in Patanjali&rsquo;s
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;shya</i>, which show that K&#257;vya flourished in
his day, and must have been developed before the beginning of our era.
Several of these quoted verses are composed in the artificial metres of
the classical poetry, while the heroic <i>anush&#7789;ubh
&ccedil;lokas</i> agree in matter as well as form, not with the
popular, but with the court epics.</p>
<p>We further know that A&ccedil;vaghosha&rsquo;s
<i>Buddha-charita</i>, or &ldquo;Doings of Buddha,&rdquo; was
translated into Chinese between 414 and 421 A.D. This work not only
calls itself a <i>mah&#257;k&#257;vya</i>, or &ldquo;great court
epic,&rdquo; but is actually written in the K&#257;vya style.
<span class="sc">A&ccedil;vaghosha</span> was, according to the
Buddhist tradition, a contemporary of King Kanishka, and would thus
belong to the first century A.D. In any case, it is evident that his
poem could not have been composed later than between 350 and 400 A.D.
The mere fact, too, that a Buddhist monk thus early conceived the plan
of writing the legend of Buddha according to the rules of the classical
Sanskrit epic shows how popular the Brahmanical artificial poetry must
have become, at any rate by the fourth century A.D., and probably long
before.</p>
<p>The progress of epigraphic research during the last quarter of a
century has begun to shed considerable light on the history of court
poetry during the dark age embracing the first five centuries of our
era. Mr. Fleet&rsquo;s third volume of the <i>Corpus Inscriptionum
Indicarum</i> contains no fewer than eighteen inscriptions of
importance in this respect. These are written mostly in verse, but
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href="#pb320" name=
"pb320">320</a>]</span>partly also in elevated prose. They cover a
period of two centuries, from about 350 to 550 A.D. Most of them employ
the Gupta era, beginning A.D. 319, and first used by Chandragupta II.,
named Vikram&#257;ditya, whose inscriptions and coins range from A.D.
400 to 413. A few of them employ the M&#257;lava era, the earlier name
of the Vikrama era, which dates from 57 B.C. Several of these
inscriptions are <i>pra&ccedil;astis</i> or panegyrics on kings. An
examination of them proves that the poetical style prevailing in the
fourth, fifth, and sixth centuries did not differ from that of the
classical K&#257;vyas which have been preserved. Samudragupta, the
second of the Gupta line, who belongs to the second half of the fourth
century, was, we learn, himself a poet, as well as a supporter of
poets. Among the latter was at least one, by name Harishe&#7751;a, who
in his panegyric on his royal patron, which consists of some thirty
lines (nine stanzas) of poetry and about an equal number of lines of
prose, shows a mastery of style rivalling that of K&#257;lid&#257;sa
and Da&#7751;&#7693;in. In agreement with the rule of all the Sanskrit
treatises on poetics, his prose is full of inordinately long compounds,
one of them containing more than 120 syllables. In his poetry he, like
K&#257;lid&#257;sa and others, follows the Vidarbha style, in which the
avoidance of long compounds is a leading characteristic. In this style,
which must have been fully developed by A.D. 300, is also written an
inscription by V&#299;rasena, the minister of Chandragupta II.,
Samudragupta&rsquo;s successor.</p>
<p>A very important inscription dates from the year 529 of the
M&#257;lava (Vikrama) era, or A.D. 473. It consists of a poem of no
fewer than forty-four stanzas (containing 150 metrical lines), composed
by a poet named Vatsabha&#7789;&#7789;i, to commemorate the
consecration of a temple <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href=
"#pb321" name="pb321">321</a>]</span>of the sun at Da&ccedil;apura (now
Mandasor). A detailed examination of this inscription not only leads to
the conclusion that in the fifth century a rich K&#257;vya literature
must have existed, but in particular shows that the poem has several
affinities with K&#257;lid&#257;sa&rsquo;s writings. The latter fact
renders it probable that Vatsabha&#7789;&#7789;i, a man of inferior
poetic talent, who professes to have produced his work with effort,
knew and utilised the poems of K&#257;lid&#257;sa. The reign of
Chandragupta Vikram&#257;ditya II., at the beginning of the fifth
century A.D., therefore seems in the meantime the most probable
approximate date for India&rsquo;s greatest poet.</p>
<p>Besides the epigraphic evidence of the Gupta period, we have two
important literary prose inscriptions of considerable length, one from
Girn&#257;r and the other from N&#257;sik, both belonging to the second
century A.D. They show that even then there existed a prose K&#257;vya
style which, in general character and in many details, resembled that
of the classical tales and romances. For they not only employ long and
frequent compounds, but also the ornaments of alliteration and various
kinds of simile and metaphor. Their use of poetical figures is,
however, much less frequent and elaborate, occasionally not going
beyond the simplicity of the popular epic. They are altogether less
artificial than the prose parts of Harishe&#7751;a&rsquo;s K&#257;vya,
and <i>&agrave; fortiori</i> than the works of Da&#7751;&#7693;in.
Subandhu, and B&#257;&#7751;a. From the Girn&#257;r inscription it
appears that its author must have been acquainted with a theory of
poetics, that metrical K&#257;vyas conforming to the rules of the
Vidarbha style were composed in his day, and that poetry of this kind
was cultivated at the courts of princes then as in later times. It
cannot be supposed that K&#257;vya literature was a new invention
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name=
"pb322">322</a>]</span>of the second century; it must, on the contrary,
have passed through a lengthened development before that time. Thus
epigraphy not merely confirms the evidence of the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;shya</i> that artificial court poetry originated
before the commencement of our era, but shows that that poetry
continued to be cultivated throughout the succeeding centuries.</p>
<p>These results of the researches of the late Professor B&uuml;hler
and of Mr. Fleet render untenable Professor Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s
well-known theory of the renaissance of Sanskrit literature in the
sixth century, which was set forth by that scholar with his usual
brilliance in <i>India, what can it Teach us?</i> and which held the
field for several years.</p>
<p>Professor Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s preliminary assertion that the
Indians, in consequence of the incursions of the &Ccedil;akas
(Scythians) and other foreigners, ceased from literary activity during
the first two centuries A.D., is refuted by the evidence of the last
two inscriptions mentioned above. Any such interruption of intellectual
life during that period is, even apart from epigraphical testimony,
rendered highly improbable by other considerations. The Scythians, in
the first place, permanently subjugated only about one-fifth of India;
for their dominion, which does not appear to have extended farther east
than Mathur&#257; (Muttra), was limited to the Panj&#257;b, Sindh,
Gujarat, R&#257;jputana, and the Central Indian Agency. The conquerors,
moreover, rapidly became Hinduised. Most of them already had Indian
names in the second generation. One of them, Ushabhad&#257;ta (the
Sanskrit &#7770;ishabhadatta), described his exploits in an inscription
composed in a mixture of Sanskrit and Pr&#257;krit. Kanishka himself
(78 A.D.), as well as his successors, was a patron of Buddhism; and
national Indian architecture <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href=
"#pb323" name="pb323">323</a>]</span>and sculpture attained a high
development at Mathur&#257; under these rulers. When the invaders thus
rapidly acquired the civilisation of the comparatively small portion of
India they conquered, there is no reason to assume the suppression of
literary activity in that part of the country, much less in India as a
whole.</p>
<p>The main thesis of Professor Max M&uuml;ller is, that in the middle
of the sixth century A.D. the reign of a King Vikram&#257;ditya of
Ujjain, with whom tradition connected the names of K&#257;lid&#257;sa
and other distinguished authors, was the golden age of Indian court
poetry. This renaissance theory is based on Fergusson&rsquo;s ingenious
chronological hypothesis that a supposed King Vikrama of Ujjain, having
expelled the Scythians from India, in commemoration of his victory
founded the Vikrama era in 544 A.D., dating its commencement back 600
years to 57 B.C. The epigraphical researches of Mr. Fleet have
destroyed Fergusson&rsquo;s hypothesis. From these researches it
results that the Vikrama era of 57 B.C., far from having been founded
in 544 A.D., had already been in use for more than a century previously
under the name of the M&#257;lava era (which came to be called the
Vikrama era about 800 A.D.). It further appears that no &Ccedil;akas
(Scythians) could have been driven out of Western India in the middle
of the sixth century, because that country had already been conquered
by the Guptas more than a hundred years before. Lastly, it turns out
that, though other foreign conquerors, the H&#363;&#7751;as, were
actually expelled from Western India in the first half of the sixth
century, they were driven out, not by a Vikram&#257;ditya, but by a
king named Ya&ccedil;odharman Vish&#7751;uvardhana.</p>
<p>Thus the great King Vikram&#257;ditya vanishes from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name="pb324">324</a>]</span>the
historical ground of the sixth century into the realm of myth. With
Vikram&#257;ditya an often-quoted but ill-authenticated verse occurring
in a work of the sixteenth century associates Dhanvantari,
Kshapa&#7751;aka, Amarasim&#803;ha, Var&#257;hamihira, and Vararuchi as
among the &ldquo;nine gems&rdquo; of his court. With the disappearance
of Vikrama from the sixth century A.D. this verse has lost all
chronological validity with reference to the date of the authors it
enumerates; it is even inadmissible to conclude from such legendary
testimony that they were contemporaries. Even though one of them,
Var&#257;hamihira, actually does belong to the sixth century, each of
them can now only be placed in the sixth century separately and by
other arguments. Apart from the mythical Vikram&#257;ditya, there is
now no reason to suppose that court poetry attained a special
development in that century, for Harishe&#7751;a&rsquo;s paneygyric,
and some other epigraphic poems of the Gupta period, show that it
flourished greatly at least two hundred years earlier.</p>
<p>None of the other arguments by which it has been attempted to place
<span class="sc">K&#257;lid&#257;sa</span> separately in the sixth
century have any cogency. One of the chief of these is derived from the
explanation given by the fourteenth-century commentator,
Mallin&#257;tha, of the word <i>dign&#257;ga</i>,
&ldquo;world-elephant,&rdquo; occurring in the 14th stanza of
K&#257;lid&#257;sa&rsquo;s <i>Meghad&#363;ta</i>. He sees in it a
punning allusion to Dign&#257;ga, a hated rival of the poet. This
explanation, to begin with, is extremely dubious in itself. Then it is
uncertain whether Mallin&#257;tha means the Buddhist teacher
Dign&#257;ga. Thirdly, little weight can be attached to the Buddhistic
tradition that Dign&#257;ga was a pupil of Vasubandhu, for this
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name=
"pb325">325</a>]</span>statement is not found till the sixteenth
century. Fourthly, the assertion that Vasubandhu belongs to the sixth
century depends chiefly on the Vikram&#257;ditya theory, and is opposed
to Chinese evidence, which indicates that works of Vasubandhu were
translated in A.D. 404. Thus every link in the chain of this argument
is very weak.</p>
<p>The other main argument is that K&#257;lid&#257;sa must have lived
after &#256;ryabha&#7789;a (A.D. 499), because he shows a knowledge of
the scientific astronomy borrowed from the Greeks. But it has been
shown by Dr. Thibaut that an Indian astronomical treatise, undoubtedly
written under Greek influence, the <i>Romaka Siddh&#257;nta</i>, is
older than &#256;ryabha&#7789;a, and cannot be placed later than A.D.
400. It may be added that a passage of K&#257;lid&#257;sa&rsquo;s
<i>Raghuvam&#803;&ccedil;a</i> (xiv. 40) has been erroneously adduced
in support of the astronomical argument, as implying that eclipses of
the moon are due to the shadow of the earth: it really refers only to
the spots in the moon as caused, in accordance with the doctrine of the
Pur&#257;&#7751;as, by a reflection of the earth.</p>
<p>Thus there is, in the present state of our knowledge, good reason to
suppose that K&#257;lid&#257;sa lived not in the sixth, but in the
beginning of the fifth century A.D. The question of his age, however,
is not likely to be definitely solved till the language, the style, and
the poetical technique of each of his works have been minutely
investigated, in comparison with datable epigraphic documents, as well
as with the rules given by the oldest Sanskrit treatises on
poetics.</p>
<p>As the popular epic poetry of the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> was
the chief source of the Pur&#257;&#7751;as, so the
<i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i>, the earliest artificial epic, was
succeeded, though after <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href=
"#pb326" name="pb326">326</a>]</span>a long interval of time, by a
number of K&#257;vyas ranging from the fifth to the twelfth century.
While in the old epic poetry form is subordinated to matter, it is of
primary importance in the K&#257;vyas, the matter becoming more and
more merely a means for the display of tricks of style. The later the
author of a K&#257;vya is, the more he seeks to win the admiration of
his audience by the cleverness of his conceits and the ingenuity of his
diction, appealing always to the head rather than the heart. Even the
very best of the K&#257;vyas were composed in more strict conformity,
with fixed rules than the poetry of any other country. For not only is
the language dominated by the grammatical rules of P&#257;&#7751;ini,
but the style is regulated by the elaborate laws about various forms of
alliteration and figures of speech laid down in the treatises on
poetics.</p>
<p>The two most important K&#257;vyas are K&#257;lid&#257;sa&rsquo;s
<i>Raghuvam&#803;&ccedil;a</i> and <i>Kum&#257;ra-sambhava</i>, both
distinguished by independence of treatment as well as considerable
poetical beauty. They have several stanzas in common, many others which
offer but slight variations, and a large number of passages which,
though differing in expression, are strikingly analogous in thought. In
both poems, too, the same metre is employed to describe the same
situation. In both poems each canto is, as a rule, composed in one
metre, but changes with the beginning of the new canto. The prevailing
metres are the classical form of the <i>anush&#7789;ubh</i> and the
<i>upaj&#257;ti</i>, a development of the Vedic
<i>trish&#7789;ubh</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Raghuvam&#803;&ccedil;a</i>, or &ldquo;Race of Raghu,&rdquo;
which consists of nineteen cantos, describes the life of R&#257;ma
together with an account of his forefathers and successors. The first
nine cantos deal with his nearest four ancestors, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href="#pb327" name=
"pb327">327</a>]</span>beginning with Dil&#299;pa and his son Raghu.
The story of R&#257;ma occupies the next six (x.&ndash;xv.), and agrees
pretty closely with that in the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> of
V&#257;lm&#299;ki, whom K&#257;lid&#257;sa here (xv. 41) speaks of as
&ldquo;the first poet.&rdquo; The following two cantos are concerned
with the three nearest descendants of R&#257;ma, while the last two run
through the remainder of twenty-four kings who reigned in Ayodhy&#257;
as his descendants, ending rather abruptly with the death of the
voluptuous King Agnivar&#7751;a. The names of these successors of
R&#257;ma agree closely with those in the list given in the
<i>Vish&#7751;u-pur&#257;&#7751;a</i>.</p>
<p>The narrative in the <i>Raghuvam&#803;&ccedil;a</i> moves with some
rapidity, not being too much impeded by long descriptions. It abounds
with apt and striking similes and contains much genuine poetry, while
the style, for a K&#257;vya, is simple, though many passages are
undoubtedly too artificial for the European taste. The following
stanza, sung by a bard whose duty it is to waken the king in the
morning (v. 75), may serve as a specimen&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">The flow&rsquo;rs to thee presented droop and fade,</p>
<p class="line">The lamps have lost the wreath of rays they shed,</p>
<p class="line">Thy sweet-voiced parrot, in his cage confined,</p>
<p class="line">Repeats the call we sound to waken thee.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">More than twenty commentaries on the
<i>Raghuvam&#803;&ccedil;a</i> are known. The most famous is the
<i>Sam&#803;j&#299;van&#299;</i> of <span class=
"sc">Mallin&#257;tha</span>, who explains every word of the text, and
who has the great merit of endeavouring to find out and preserve the
readings of the poet himself. He knew a number of earlier commentaries,
among which he names with approval those of Dakshi&#7751;&#257;varta
and N&#257;tha. The latter no longer exist. Among the other extant
commentaries may be mentioned the <i>Subodhin&#299;</i>, composed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name=
"pb328">328</a>]</span>by Dinakara Mi&ccedil;ra in 1385, and the
<i>&Ccedil;i&ccedil;uhitaishi&#7751;&#299;</i>, by a Jain named
Ch&#257;ritravardhana, of which Dinakara&rsquo;s work appears to be an
epitome.</p>
<p>The <i>Kum&#257;ra-sambhava</i>, or the &ldquo;Birth of the
War-god,&rdquo; consists, when complete, of seventeen cantos. The first
seven are entirely devoted to the courtship and wedding of the god
&Ccedil;iva and of P&#257;rvat&#299;, daughter of Him&#257;laya, the
parents of the youthful god. This fact in itself indicates that
description is the prevailing characteristic of the poem. It abounds in
that poetical miniature painting in which lies the chief literary
strength of the Indian. Affording the poet free scope for the
indulgence of his rich and original imaginative powers, it is
conspicuous for wealth of illustration. The following rendering of a
stanza in the <i>Viyogin&#299;</i> metre (in which lines of ten and
eleven syllables ending iambically alternate) may serve as a specimen.
The poet shows how the duty of a wife following her husband in death is
exemplified even by objects in Nature poetically conceived as
spouses&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">After the Lord of Night the moonlight goes,</p>
<p class="line">Along with the cloud the lightning is dissolved:</p>
<p class="line">Wives ever follow in their husbands&rsquo; path;</p>
<p class="line">Even things bereft of sense obey this law.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Usually the first seven cantos only are to be found in
the printed editions, owing to the excessively erotic character of the
remaining ten. The poem concludes with an account of the destruction of
the demon T&#257;raka, the object for which the god of war was
born.</p>
<p>More than twenty commentaries on the <i>Kum&#257;ra-sambhava</i>
have been preserved. Several of them are by the same authors, notably
Mallin&#257;tha, as those on the <i>Raghuvam&#803;&ccedil;a</i>.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329" name=
"pb329">329</a>]</span></p>
<p>The subject-matter of the later K&#257;vyas, which is derived from
the two great epics, becomes more and more mixed up with lyric, erotic,
and didactic elements. It is increasingly regarded as a means for the
display of elaborate conceits, till at last nothing remains but bombast
and verbal jugglery. The <i>Bha&#7789;&#7789;i-k&#257;vya</i>, written
in Valabh&#299; under King &Ccedil;r&#299;dharasena, probably in the
seventh century, and ascribed by various commentators to the poet and
grammarian Bhart&#7771;ihari (died 651 A.D.), deals in 22 cantos with
the story of R&#257;ma, but only with the object of illustrating the
forms of Sanskrit grammar.</p>
<p>The <i>Kir&#257;t&#257;rjun&#299;ya</i> describes, in eighteen
cantos, the combat, first narrated in the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>,
between &Ccedil;iva, in the guise of a <i>Kir&#257;ta</i> or
mountaineer, and Arjuna. It cannot have been composed later than the
sixth century, as its author, <span class="sc">Bh&#257;ravi</span>, is
mentioned in an inscription of 634 A.D. The fifteenth canto of this
poem contains a number of stanzas illustrating all kinds of verbal
tricks like those described in Da&#7751;&#7693;in&rsquo;s
<i>K&#257;vy&#257;dar&ccedil;a</i>. Thus one stanza (14) contains no
consonant but <i>n</i> (excepting a <i>t</i> at the end);<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e10338src" href="#xd21e10338" name=
"xd21e10338src">1</a> while each half-line in a subsequent one (25), if
its syllables be read backwards, is identical with the other
half.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10345src" href="#xd21e10345" name=
"xd21e10345src">2</a></p>
<p>The <i>&Ccedil;i&ccedil;up&#257;la-vadha</i>, or &ldquo;Death of
&Ccedil;i&ccedil;up&#257;la,&rdquo; describes, in twenty cantos, how
that prince, son of a king of Chedi, and cousin of K&#7771;ish&#7751;a,
was slain by Vish&#7751;u. Having been composed by the poet
<span class="sc">M&#257;gha</span>, it also goes by the name of
<i>M&#257;gha-k&#257;vya</i>. It probably dates from the ninth, and
must undoubtedly have been composed before the end of the tenth
century. The nineteenth canto is full <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb330" href="#pb330" name="pb330">330</a>]</span>of metrical puzzles,
some of a highly complex character (<i>e.g.</i> 29). It contains an
example of a stanza (34) which, if read backwards, is identical with
the preceding one read in the ordinary way. At the same time this
K&#257;vya is, as a whole, by no means lacking in poetical beauties and
striking thoughts.</p>
<p>The <i>Naishadh&#299;ya</i> (also called <i>Naishadha-charita</i>),
in twenty-two cantos, deals with the story of Nala, king of Nishada,
the well-known episode of the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>. It was
composed by <span class="sc">&Ccedil;r&#299;harsha</span>, who belongs
to the latter half of the twelfth century.</p>
<p>These six artificial epics are recognised as
<i>Mah&#257;k&#257;vyas</i>, or &ldquo;Great Poems,&rdquo; and have all
been commented on by Mallin&#257;tha. The characteristics of this
higher class are set forth by Da&#7751;&#7693;in in his
<i>K&#257;vy&#257;dar&ccedil;a</i>, or &ldquo;Mirror of Poetry&rdquo;
(i. 14&ndash;19). Their subjects must be derived from epic story
(<i>itih&#257;sa</i>), they should be extensive, and ought to be
embellished with descriptions of cities, seas, mountains, seasons,
sunrise, weddings, battles fought by the hero, and so forth.</p>
<p>An extensive Mah&#257;k&#257;vya, in fifty cantos, is the
<i>Haravijaya</i>, or &ldquo;Victory of &Ccedil;iva,&rdquo; by a
Kashmirian poet named <span class="sc">Ratn&#257;kara</span>, who
belongs to the ninth century.</p>
<p>Another late epic, narrating the fortunes of the same hero as the
<i>Naishadh&#299;ya</i>, is the <i>Nalodaya</i>, or &ldquo;Rise of
Nala,&rdquo; which describes the restoration to power of King Nala
after he had lost his all. Though attributed to K&#257;lid&#257;sa, it
is unmistakably the product of a much later age. The chief aim of the
author is to show off his skill in the manipulation of the most varied
and artificial metres, as well as all the elaborate tricks of style
exhibited in the latest K&#257;vyas. Rhyme even is introduced, and
that, too, not only at the end of, but within metrical lines.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name=
"pb331">331</a>]</span>The really epic material is but scantily
treated, narrative making way for long descriptions and lyrical
effusions. Thus the second and longest of the four cantos of the poem
is purely lyrical, describing only the bliss of the newly-wedded pair,
with all kinds of irrelevant additions.</p>
<p>The culmination of artificiality is attained by the
<i>R&#257;ghava-p&#257;&#7751;&#7693;av&#299;ya</i>, a poem composed by
<span class="sc">Kavir&#257;ja</span>, who perhaps flourished about
A.D. 800. It celebrates simultaneously the actions of R&#257;ghava or
R&#257;ma and of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ava princes. The composition
is so arranged that by the use of ambiguous words and phrases the story
of the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> and the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> is told at one and the same time. The same
words, according to the sense in which they are understood, narrate the
events of each epic. A <i>tour de force</i> of this kind is doubtless
unique in the literatures of the world. Kavir&#257;ja has, however,
found imitators in India itself.</p>
<p>A Mah&#257;k&#257;vya which is as yet only known in MS. is the
<i>Navas&#257;has&#257;nka-charita</i>, a poem celebrating the doings
of Navas&#257;has&#257;nka, otherwise Sindhur&#257;ja, a king of
M&#257;lava, and composed by a poet named <span class=
"sc">Padmagupta</span>, who lived about 1000 A.D. It consists of
eighteen cantos, containing over 1500 stanzas in nineteen different
metres. The poet refrains from the employment of metrical tricks; but
he greatly impedes the progress of the narrative by introducing
interminable speeches and long-winded descriptions.</p>
<p>We may mention, in conclusion, that there is also an epic in
Pr&#257;krit which is attributed to K&#257;lid&#257;sa. This is the
<i>Setu-bandha</i>, &ldquo;Building of the Bridge,&rdquo; or
<i>R&#257;va&#7751;avadha</i>, &ldquo;Death of
R&#257;va&#7751;a,&rdquo; which relates the story of R&#257;ma. It is
supposed to have been composed by the poet to commemorate the building
of a bridge of boats <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href="#pb332"
name="pb332">332</a>]</span>across the Vitast&#257; (Jhelum) by King
Pravarasena of Kashmir.</p>
<p>There are a few prose romances dating from the sixth and seventh
centuries, which being classed as K&#257;vyas by the Sanskrit writers
on poetics, may be mentioned in this place. The abundant use of immense
compounds, which of course makes them very difficult reading, is an
essential characteristic of the style of these works. As to their
matter, they contain but little action, consisting largely of scenes
which are strung together by a meagre thread of narrative, and are made
the occasion of lengthy descriptions full of long strings of
comparisons and often teeming with puns. In spite, however, of their
highly artificial and involved style, many really poetical thoughts may
be found embedded in what to the European taste is an unattractive
setting.</p>
<p>The <i>Da&ccedil;a-kum&#257;ra-charita</i>, or &ldquo;Adventures of
the Ten Princes,&rdquo; contains stories of common life and reflects a
corrupt state of society. It is by <span class=
"sc">Da&#7751;&#7693;in</span>, and probably dates from the sixth
century A.D. <i>V&#257;savadatt&#257;</i>, by Subandhu, relates the
popular story of the heroine V&#257;savadatt&#257;, princess of
Ujjayin&#299;, and Udayana, king of Vatsa. It was probably written
quite at the beginning of the seventh century. Slightly later is
<span class="sc">B&#257;&#7751;a&rsquo;s</span>
<i>K&#257;dambar&#299;</i>, a poetical romance narrating the fortunes
of a princess of that name. Another work of a somewhat similar
character by the same author is the <i>Harsha-charita</i>, a romance in
eight chapters, in which B&#257;&#7751;a attempts to give some account
of the life of King Harshavardhana of Kanauj. There is, however, but
little narrative. Thus in twenty-five pages of the eighth chapter there
are to be found five long descriptions, extending on the average to two
pages, to say nothing of shorter ones. There is, for instance,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333" name=
"pb333">333</a>]</span>a long disquisition, covering four pages, and
full of strings of comparisons, about the miseries of servitude. A
servant, &ldquo;like a painted bow, is for ever bent in the one act of
distending a string of imaginary virtues, but there is no force in him;
like a heap of dust-sweepings gathered by a broom, he carries off
toilet-leavings; like the meal offered to the Divine Mothers, he is
cast out into space even at night; like a pumping machine, he has left
all weight behind him and bends even for water,&rdquo; and so on. Soon
after comes a description, covering two pages, of the trees in a
forest. This is immediately followed by another page enumerating the
various kinds of students thronging the wood in order to avail
themselves of the teaching of a great Buddhist sage; they even include
monkeys busily engaged in ritual ceremonies, devout parrots expounding
a Buddhist dictionary, owls lecturing on the various births of Buddha,
and tigers who have given up eating flesh under the calming influence
of Buddhist teaching. Next comes a page describing the sage himself.
&ldquo;He was clad in a very soft red cloth, as if he were the eastern
quarter of the sky bathed in the morning sunshine, teaching the other
quarters to assume the red Buddhist attire, while they were flushed
with the pure red glow of his body like a ruby freshly cut.&rdquo; Soon
after comes a long account, bristling with puns, of a disconsolate
princess lying prostrate in the wood&mdash;&ldquo;lost in the forest
and in thought, bent upon death and the root of a tree, fallen upon
calamity and her nurse&rsquo;s bosom, parted from her husband and
happiness, burned with the fierce sunshine and the woes of widowhood,
her mouth closed with silence as well as by her hand, and held fast by
her companions as well as by grief. I saw her with her kindred
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334" name=
"pb334">334</a>]</span>and her graces all gone, her ears and her soul
left bare, her ornaments and her aims abandoned, her bracelets and her
hopes broken, her companions and the needle-like grass-spears clinging
round her feet, her eye and her beloved fixed within her bosom, her
sighs and her hair long, her limbs and her merits exhausted, her aged
attendants and her streaming tears falling down at her feet,&rdquo; and
so forth. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335" name=

<h2 class="main">Lyric Poetry</h2>
<h2 class="main">(<i>Circa</i> 400&ndash;1100 A.D.)</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Sanskrit lyrical poetry has not produced many works of
any considerable length. But among these are included two of the most
perfect creations of K&#257;lid&#257;sa, a writer distinguished no less
in this field than as an epic and a dramatic author. His lyrical talent
is, indeed, also sufficiently prominent in his plays.</p>
<p>K&#257;lid&#257;sa&rsquo;s <i>Meghad&#363;ta</i>, or &ldquo;Cloud
Messenger,&rdquo; is a lyrical gem which won the admiration of Goethe.
It consists of 115 stanzas composed in the <i>Mand&#257;kr&#257;nta</i>
metre of four lines of seventeen syllables. The theme is a message
which an exile sends by a cloud to his wife dwelling far away. The idea
is applied by Schiller in his <i>Maria Stuart</i>, where the captive
Queen of Scots calls on the clouds as they fly southwards to greet the
land of her youth (act iii. sc. 1). The exile is a Yaksha or attendant
of Kubera, the god of wealth, who for neglect of his duty has been
banished to the groves on the slopes of R&#257;magiri in Central India.
Emaciated and melancholy, he sees, at the approach of the rainy season,
a dark cloud moving northwards. The sight fills his heart with
yearning, and impels him to address to the cloud a request to convey a
message of hope to his wife in the remote Him&#257;laya. In the first
half of the poem the Yaksha describes with much power and beauty the
various scenes the cloud must traverse on its northward course:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336" name=
"pb336">336</a>]</span>Mount &#256;mrak&#363;&#7789;a, on whose peak it
will rest after quenching with showers the forest fires; the
Narmad&#257;, winding at the foot of the Vindhya hills; the town of
Vidi&ccedil;&#257; (Bhilsa), and the stream of the Vetravat&#299;
(Betwah); the city of Ujjayin&#299; (Ujjain) in the land of Avanti; the
sacred region of Kurukshetra; the Ganges and the mountains from which
she sprang, white with snowfields, till Alak&#257; on Mount
Kail&#257;sa is finally reached.</p>
<p>In the second half of the poem the Yaksha first describes the
beauties of this city and his own dwelling there. Going on to paint in
glowing colours the charms of his wife, her surroundings, and her
occupations, he imagines her tossing on her couch, sleepless and
emaciated, through the watches of the night. Then, when her eye rests
on the window, the cloud shall proclaim to her with thunder-sound her
husband&rsquo;s message, that he is still alive and ever longs to
behold her:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">In creepers I discern thy form, in eyes of startled
hinds thy glances,</p>
<p class="line">And in the moon thy lovely face, in peacocks&rsquo;
plumes thy shining tresses;</p>
<p class="line">The sportive frown upon thy brow in flowing
waters&rsquo; tiny ripples:</p>
<p class="line">But never in one place combined can I, alas! behold thy
likeness.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But courage, he says; our sorrow will end at
last&mdash;we shall be re-united&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">And then we will our hearts&rsquo; desire, grown more
intense by separation,</p>
<p class="line">Enjoy in nights all glorious and bright, with
full-orbed autumn moonlight.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Then begging the cloud, after delivering his message,
to return with reassuring news, the exile finally dismisses him with
the hope that he may never, even for a moment, be divided from his
lightning spouse. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337"

<p>Besides the expression of emotion, the descriptive element is very
prominent in this fine poem. This is still more true of
K&#257;lid&#257;sa&rsquo;s <i>&#7770;itusam&#803;h&#257;ra</i>, or
&ldquo;Cycle of the Seasons.&rdquo; That little work, which consists of
153 stanzas in six cantos, and is composed in various metres, is a
highly poetical description of the six seasons into which classical
Sanskrit poets usually divide the Indian year. With glowing
descriptions of the beauties of Nature, in which erotic scenes are
interspersed, the poet adroitly interweaves the expression of human
emotions. Perhaps no other work of K&#257;lid&#257;sa&rsquo;s manifests
so strikingly the poet&rsquo;s deep sympathy with Nature, his keen
powers of observation, and his skill in depicting an Indian landscape
in vivid colours.</p>
<p>The poem opens with an account of summer. If the glow of the sun is
then too great during the day, the moonlit nights are all the more
delightful to lovers. The moon, beholding the face of beauteous
maidens, is beside itself with jealousy; then, too, it is that the
heart of the wanderer is burnt by the fire of separation. Next follows
a brilliant description of the effects of the heat: the thirst or
lethargy it produces in serpent, lion, elephant, buffalo, boar,
gazelle, peacock, crane, frogs, and fishes; the devastation caused by
the forest fire which devours trees and shrubs, and drives before it
crowds of terror-stricken beasts.</p>
<p>The close heat is succeeded by the rains, which are announced by the
approach of the dark heavy clouds with their banner of lightning and
drum of thunder. Slowly they move accompanied by <i>ch&#257;taka</i>
birds, fabled to live exclusively on raindrops, till at length they
discharge their water. The wild streams, like wanton girls,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name=
"pb338">338</a>]</span>grasp in a trice the tottering trees upon their
banks, as they rush onwards to the sea. The earth becomes covered with
young blades of grass, and the forests clothe themselves with golden
buds&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">The mountains fill the soul with yearning thoughts of
love,</p>
<p class="line">When rain-charged clouds bend down to kiss the
tow&rsquo;ring rocks,</p>
<p class="line">When all around upon their slopes the streams gush
down,</p>
<p class="line">And throngs of peacocks that begin to dance are
seen.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Next comes the autumn, beauteous as a newly-wedded
bride, with face of full-blown lotuses, with robe of sugarcane and
ripening rice, with the cry of flamingoes representing the tinkling of
her anklets. The graceful creepers vie with the arms of lovely women,
and the jasmine, showing through the crimson <i>a&ccedil;oka</i>
blossoms, rivals the dazzling teeth and red lips of smiling
maidens.</p>
<p>Winter follows, when the rice ripens, while the lotus fades and the
fields in the morning are covered with rime&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">Then the Priyangu creeper, reaching ripeness,</p>
<p class="line">Buffeted constantly by chilling breezes,</p>
<p class="line">Grows, O Beloved, ever pale and paler,</p>
<p class="line">Like lonely maiden from her lover parted.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">This is the time dear to lovers, whose joys the poet
describes in glowing colours.</p>
<p>In the cold season a fire and the mild rays of the sun are pleasant.
The night does not attract lovers now, for the moonbeams are cold and
the light of the stars is pale.</p>
<p>The poet dwells longest on the delights of spring, the last of the
six seasons. It is then that maidens, with <i>kar&#7751;ik&#257;ra</i>
flowers on their ears, with red <i>a&ccedil;oka</i> blossoms and sprays
of jasmine in their locks, go to meet their lovers. Then the hum of
intoxicated bees is heard, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339"
href="#pb339" name="pb339">339</a>]</span>the note of the Indian
cuckoo; then the blossoms of the mango-tree are seen: these are the
sharp arrows wherewith the god of the flowery bow enflames the hearts
of maidens to love.</p>
<p>A lyric poem of a very artificial character, and consisting of only
twenty-two stanzas, is the <i>Gha&#7789;a-karpara</i>, or
&ldquo;Potsherd,&rdquo; called after the author&rsquo;s name, which is
worked into the last verse. The date of the poet is unknown. He is
mentioned as one of the &ldquo;nine gems&rdquo; at the court of the
mythical Vikram&#257;ditya in the verse already mentioned.</p>
<p>The <i>Chaura-panch&#257;&ccedil;ik&#257;</i>, or &ldquo;Fifty
Stanzas of the Thief,&rdquo; is a lyrical poem which contains many
beauties. Its author was the Kashmirian Bilha&#7751;a, who belongs to
the later half of the eleventh century. According to the romantic
tradition, this poet secretly enjoyed the love of a princess, and when
found out was condemned to death. He thereupon composed fifty stanzas,
each beginning with the words &ldquo;Even now I remember,&rdquo; in
which he describes with glowing enthusiasm the joys of love he had
experienced. Their effect on the king was so great that he forgave the
poet and bestowed on him the hand of his daughter.</p>
<p>The main bulk of the lyrical creations of medi&aelig;val India are
not connected poems of considerable length, but consist of that
miniature painting which, as with a few strokes, depicts an amatory
situation or sentiment in a single stanza of four lines. These lyrics
are in many respects cognate to the sententious poetry which the
Indians cultivated with such eminent success. Bearing evidence of great
wealth of observation and depth of feeling, they are often drawn by a
master-hand. Many of them are in matter and form gems of perfect
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340" name=
"pb340">340</a>]</span>beauty. Some of their charm is, however, lost in
translation owing to the impossibility of reproducing the elaborate
metres employed in the original. Several Sanskrit poets composed
collections of these miniature lyrics.</p>
<p>The most eminent of these authors is <span class=
"sc">Bhart&#7771;ihari</span>, grammarian, philosopher, and poet in
one. Only the literary training of India could make such a combination
possible, and even there it has hardly a parallel. Bhart&#7771;ihari
lived in the first half of the seventh century. The Chinese traveller I
Tsing, who spent more than twenty years in India at the end of that
century, records that, having turned Buddhist monk, the poet again
became a layman, and fluctuated altogether seven times between the
monastery and the world. Bhart&#7771;ihari blamed himself for, but
could not overcome, his inconstancy. He wrote three centuries of
detached stanzas. Of the first and last, which are sententious in
character, there will be occasion to say something later. Only the
second, entitled <i>&Ccedil;&#7771;ing&#257;ra-&ccedil;ataka</i>, or
&ldquo;Century of Love,&rdquo; deals with erotic sentiment. Here
Bhart&#7771;ihari, in graceful and meditative verse, shows himself to
be well acquainted both with the charms of women and with the arts by
which they captivate the hearts of men. Who, he asks in one of these
miniature poems, is not filled with yearning thoughts of love in
spring, when the air swoons with the scent of the mango blossom and is
filled with the hum of bees intoxicated with honey? In another he avers
that none can resist the charms of lotus-eyed maidens, not even learned
men, whose utterances about renouncing love are mere idle words. The
poet himself laments that, when his beloved is away, the brightness
goes out of his life&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href=
"#pb341" name="pb341">341</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">Beside the lamp, the flaming hearth,</p>
<p class="line">In light of sun or moon and stars,</p>
<p class="line">Without my dear one&rsquo;s lustrous eyes</p>
<p class="line">This world is wholly dark to me.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">At the same time he warns the unwary against
reflecting over-much on female beauty&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">Let not thy thoughts, O Wanderer,</p>
<p class="line">Roam in that forest, woman&rsquo;s form:</p>
<p class="line">For there a robber ever lurks,</p>
<p class="line">Ready to strike&mdash;the God of Love.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In another stanza the Indian Cupid appears as a
fisherman, who, casting on the ocean of this world a hook called woman,
quickly catches men as fishes eager for the bait of ruddy lips, and
bakes them in the fire of love.</p>
<p>Strange are the contradictions in which the poet finds himself
involved by loving a maiden&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">Remembered she but causes pain;</p>
<p class="line">At sight of her my madness grows;</p>
<p class="line">When touched, she makes my senses reel:</p>
<p class="line">How, pray, can such an one be loved?</p>
</div>
<p class="first">So towards the end of the Century the poet&rsquo;s
heart begins to turn from the allurements of love. &ldquo;Cease,
maiden,&rdquo; he exclaims, &ldquo;to cast thy glances on me: thy
trouble is in vain. I am an altered man; youth has gone by and my
thoughts are bent on the forest; my infatuation is over, and the whole
world I now account but as a wisp of straw.&rdquo; Thus
Bhart&#7771;ihari prepares the way for his third collection, the
&ldquo;Century of Renunciation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A short but charming treasury of detached erotic verses is the
<i>&Ccedil;&#7771;ing&#257;ra-tilaka</i>, which tradition attributes
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342" name=
"pb342">342</a>]</span>to K&#257;lid&#257;sa. In its twenty-three
stanzas occur some highly imaginative analogies, worked out with much
originality. In one of them, for instance, the poet asks how it comes
that a maiden, whose features and limbs resemble various tender
flowers, should have a heart of stone. In another he compares his
mistress to a hunter&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">This maiden like a huntsman is;</p>
<p class="line">Her brow is like the bow he bends;</p>
<p class="line">Her sidelong glances are his darts;</p>
<p class="line">My heart&rsquo;s the antelope she slays.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The most important lyrical work of this kind is the
<i><span class="corr" id="xd21e10654" title=
"Source: Amaru-&ccedil;ataka">Amaru&ccedil;ataka</span></i>, or
&ldquo;Hundred stanzas of Amaru.&rdquo; The author is a master in the
art of painting lovers in all their moods, bliss and dejection, anger
and devotion. He is especially skilful in depicting the various stages
of estrangement and reconciliation. It is remarkable how, with a
subject so limited, in situations and emotions so similar, the poet
succeeds in arresting the attention with surprising turns of thought,
and with subtle touches which are ever new. The love which Amaru as
well as other Indian lyrists portrays is not of the romantic and ideal,
but rather of the sensuous type. Nevertheless his work often shows
delicacy of feeling and refinement of thought. Such, for instance, is
the case when he describes a wife watching in the gloaming for the
return of her absent husband.</p>
<p>Many lyrical gems are to be found preserved in the Sanskrit
treatises on poetics. One such is a stanza on the red
<i>a&ccedil;oka</i>. In this the poet asks the tree to say whither his
mistress has gone; it need not shake its head in the wind, as if to say
it did not know; for how <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href=
"#pb343" name="pb343">343</a>]</span>could it be flowering so
brilliantly had it not been touched by the foot of his
beloved?<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10664src" href="#xd21e10664" name=
"xd21e10664src">1</a></p>
<p>In all this lyrical poetry the plant and animal world plays an
important part and is treated with much charm. Of flowers, the lotus is
the most conspicuous. One of these stanzas, for example, describes the
day-lotuses as closing their calyx-eyes in the evening, because
unwilling to see the sun, their spouse and benefactor, sink down bereft
of his rays. Another describes with pathetic beauty the dream of a bee:
&ldquo;The night will pass, the fair dawn will come, the sun will rise,
the lotuses will laugh;&rdquo; while a bee thus mused within the calyx,
an elephant, alas! tore up the lotus plant.</p>
<p>Various birds to which poetical myths are attached are frequently
introduced as furnishing analogies to human life and love. The
<i>ch&#257;taka</i>, which would rather die of thirst than drink aught
but the raindrops from the cloud, affords an illustration of pride. The
<i>chakora</i>, supposed to imbibe the rays of the moon, affords a
parallel to the lover who with his eyes drinks in the beams of his
beloved&rsquo;s face. The <i>chakrav&#257;ka</i>, which, fabled to be
condemned to nocturnal separation from his mate, calls to her with
plaintive cry during the watches of the night, serves as an emblem of
conjugal fidelity.</p>
<p>In all this lyric poetry the bright eyes and beauty of Indian girls
find a setting in scenes brilliant with blossoming trees, fragrant with
flowers, gay with the plumage and vocal with the song of birds,
diversified with lotus ponds steeped in tropical sunshine and with
large-eyed gazelles reclining in the shade. Some of its gems are well
worthy of having inspired the genius of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb344" href="#pb344" name="pb344">344</a>]</span>Heine to produce such
lyrics as <i>Die Lotosblume</i> and <i>Auf Fl&uuml;geln des
Gesanges</i>.</p>
<p>A considerable amount of lyrical poetry of the same type has also
been produced in Pr&#257;krit, especially in the extensive anthology
entitled <i>Sapta&ccedil;ataka</i>, or &ldquo;Seven Centuries,&rdquo;
of the poet H&#257;la, who probably lived before A.D. 1000. It contains
many beauties, and is altogether a rich treasury of popular Indian
lyrical poetry. It must suffice here to refer to but one of the stanzas
contained in this collection. In this little poem the moon is described
as a white swan sailing on the pure nocturnal lake of the heavens,
studded with starry lotuses.</p>
<p>The transitional stage between pure lyric and pure drama is
represented by the <i>G&#299;tagovinda</i>, or &ldquo;Cowherd in
Song,&rdquo; a lyrical drama, which, though dating from the twelfth
century, is the earliest literary specimen of a primitive type of play
that still survives in Bengal, and must have preceded the regular
dramas. The poem contains no dialogue in the proper sense, for its
three characters only engage in a kind of lyrical monologue, of which
one of the other two is supposed to be an auditor, sometimes even no
one at all. The subject of the poem is the love of K&#7771;ish&#7751;a
for the beautiful cowherdess R&#257;dh&#257;, the estrangement of the
lovers, and their final reconciliation. It is taken from that episode
of K&#7771;ish&#7751;a&rsquo;s life in which he himself was a herdsman
(<i>go-vinda</i>), living on the banks of the Yamun&#257;, and enjoying
to the full the love of the cowherdesses. The only three characters of
the poem are K&#7771;ish&#7751;a, R&#257;dh&#257;, and a confidante of
the latter.</p>
<p>Its author, Jayadeva, was probably a native of Bengal, having been a
contemporary of a Bengal king named Lakshma&#7751;asena. It is probable
that he took <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345" name=
"pb345">345</a>]</span>as his model popular plays representing
incidents from the life of K&#7771;ish&#7751;a, as the modern
<i>y&#257;tr&#257;s</i> in Bengal still do. The latter festival plays
even now consist chiefly of lyrical stanzas, partly recited and partly
sung, the dialogue being but scanty, and to a considerable extent left
to improvisation. On such a basis Jayadeva created his highly
artificial poem. The great perfection of form he has here attained, by
combining grace of diction with ease in handling the most difficult
metres, has not failed to win the admiration of all who are capable of
reading the original Sanskrit. Making abundant use of alliteration and
the most complex rhymes occurring, as in the <i>Nalodaya</i>, not only
at the end, but in the middle of metrical lines,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10716src" href="#xd21e10716" name="xd21e10716src">2</a> the poet
has adapted the most varied and melodious measures to the expression of
exuberant erotic emotions, with a skill which could not be surpassed.
It seems impossible to reproduce Jayadeva&rsquo;s verse adequately in
an English garb. The German poet R&uuml;ckert, has, however, come as
near to the highly artificial beauty of the original, both in form and
matter, as is feasible in any translation.</p>
<p>It is somewhat strange that a poem which describes the transports of
sensual love with all the exuberance of an Oriental fancy should, in
the present instance, and not for the first time, have received an
allegorical explanation in a mystical religious sense. According to
Indian interpreters, the separation of K&#7771;ish&#7751;a and
R&#257;dh&#257;, their seeking for each other, and their final
reconciliation represent the relation of the supreme deity to the human
soul. This may possibly have been the intention of Jayadeva, though
only as a leading idea, not to be followed out in detail. <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To the European mind the history of the Indian drama
cannot but be a source of abundant interest; for here we have an
important branch of literature which has had a full and varied national
development, quite independent of Western influence, and which throws
much light on Hindu social customs during the five or six centuries
preceding the Muhammadan conquest.</p>
<p>The earliest forms of dramatic literature in India are represented
by those hymns of the <i>Rigveda</i> which contain dialogues, such as
those of Saram&#257; and the Pa&#7751;is, Yama and Yam&#299;,
Pur&#363;ravas and Urva&ccedil;&#299;, the latter, indeed, being the
foundation of a regular play composed much more than a thousand years
later by the greatest dramatist of India. The origin of the acted drama
is, however, wrapt in obscurity. Nevertheless, the evidence of
tradition and of language suffice to direct us with considerable
probability to its source.</p>
<p>The words for actor (<i>na&#7789;a</i>) and play
(<i>n&#257;&#7789;aka</i>) are derived from the verb <i>na&#7789;</i>,
the Pr&#257;krit or vernacular form of the Sanskrit <i>n&#7771;it</i>,
&ldquo;to dance.&rdquo; The name is familiar to English ears in the
form of <i>nautch</i>, the Indian dancing of the present day. The
latter, indeed, probably represents the beginnings of the Indian drama.
It must at first have consisted only of rude pantomime, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href="#pb347" name="pb347">347</a>]</span>in
which the dancing movements of the body were accompanied by mute
mimicking gestures of hand and face. Songs, doubtless, also early
formed an ingredient in such performances. Thus Bharata, the name of
the mythical inventor of the drama, which in Sanskrit also means
&ldquo;actor,&rdquo; in several of the vernaculars signifies
&ldquo;singer,&rdquo; as in the Gujarat&#299; <i>Bharot</i>. The
addition of dialogue was the last step in the development, which was
thus much the same in India and in Greece. This primitive stage is
represented by the Bengal <i>y&#257;tr&#257;s</i> and the
<i>G&#299;tagovinda</i>. These form the transition to the
fully-developed Sanskrit play in which lyrics and dialogue are
blended.</p>
<p>The earliest references to the acted drama are to be found in the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;shya</i>, which mentions representations of the
<i>Kam&#803;savadha</i>, the &ldquo;Slaying of Kam&#803;sa,&rdquo; and
the <i>Balibandha</i>, or &ldquo;Binding of Bali,&rdquo; episodes in
the history of K&#7771;ish&#7751;a. Indian tradition describes Bharata
as having caused to be acted before the gods a play representing the
<i>svayam&#803;vara</i> of Lakshm&#299;, wife of Vish&#7751;u.
Tradition further makes K&#7771;ish&#7751;a and his cowherdesses the
starting-point of the <i>sam&#803;g&#299;ta</i>, a representation
consisting of a mixture of song, music, and dancing. The
<i>G&#299;tagovinda</i> is concerned with K&#7771;ish&#7751;a, and the
modern <i>y&#257;tr&#257;s</i> generally represent scenes from the life
of that deity. From all this it seems likely that the Indian drama was
developed in connection with the cult of
Vish&#7751;u-K&#7771;ish&#7751;a, and that the earliest acted
representations were therefore, like the mysteries of the Christian
Middle Ages, a kind of religious plays, in which scenes from the legend
of the god were enacted mainly with the aid of song and dance,
supplemented with prose dialogue improvised by the performers.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href="#pb348" name=
"pb348">348</a>]</span></p>
<p>The drama has had a rich and varied development in India, as is
shown not only by the numerous plays that have been preserved, but by
the native treatises on poetics which contain elaborate rules for the
construction and style of plays. Thus the
<i>S&#257;hitya-darpa&#7751;a</i>, or &ldquo;Mirror of Rhetoric,&rdquo;
divides Sanskrit dramas into two main classes, a higher
(<i>r&#363;paka</i>) and a lower (<i>upar&#363;paka</i>), and
distinguishes no fewer than ten species of the former and eighteen of
the latter.</p>
<p>The characteristic features of the Indian drama which strike the
Western student are the entire absence of tragedy, the interchange of
lyrical stanzas with prose dialogue, and the use of Sanskrit for some
characters and of Pr&#257;krit for others.</p>
<p>The Sanskrit drama is a mixed composition, in which joy is mingled
with sorrow, in which the jester usually plays a prominent part, while
the hero and heroine are often in the depths of despair. But it never
has a sad ending. The emotions of terror, grief, or pity, with which
the audience are inspired, are therefore always tranquillised by the
happy termination of the story. Nor may any deeply tragic incident take
place in the course of the play; for death is never allowed to be
represented on the stage. Indeed nothing considered indecorous, whether
of a serious or comic character, is allowed to be enacted in the sight
or hearing of the spectators, such as the utterance of a curse,
degradation, banishment, national calamity, biting, scratching,
kissing, eating, or sleeping.</p>
<p>Sanskrit plays are full of lyrical passages describing scenes or
persons presented to view, or containing reflections suggested by the
incidents that occur. They usually consist of four-line stanzas.
<i>&Ccedil;akuntal&#257;</i> contains <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb349" href="#pb349" name="pb349">349</a>]</span>nearly two hundred
such, representing something like one half of the whole play. These
lyrical passages are composed in a great many different metres. Thus
the first thirty-four stanzas of <i>&Ccedil;akuntal&#257;</i> exhibit
no fewer than eleven varieties of verse. It is not possible, as in the
case of the simple Vedic metres, to imitate in English the almost
infinite resources of the complicated and entirely quantitative
classical Sanskrit measures. The spirit of the lyrical passages is,
therefore, probably best reproduced by using blank verse as the
familiar metre of our drama. The prose of the dialogue in the plays is
often very commonplace, serving only as an introduction to the lofty
sentiment of the poetry that follows.</p>
<p>In accordance with their social position, the various characters in
a Sanskrit play speak different dialects. Sanskrit is employed only by
heroes, kings, Brahmans, and men of high rank; Pr&#257;krit by all
women and by men of the lower orders. Distinctions are further made in
the use of Pr&#257;krit itself. Thus women of high position employ
Mah&#257;r&#257;sh&#7789;r&#299; in lyrical passages, but otherwise
they, as well as children and the better class of servants, speak
&Ccedil;aurasen&#299;. M&#257;gadh&#299; is used, for instance, by
attendants in the royal palace, Avant&#299; by rogues or gamblers,
Abh&#299;r&#299; by cowherds, Pai&ccedil;&#257;ch&#299; by
charcoal-burners, and Apabhram&#803;&ccedil;a by the lowest and most
despised people as well as barbarians.</p>
<p>The Sanskrit dramatists show considerable skill in weaving the
incidents of the plot and in the portrayal of individual character, but
do not show much fertility of invention, commonly borrowing the story
of their plays from history or epic legend. Love is the subject of most
Indian dramas. The hero, usually a king, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb350" href="#pb350" name="pb350">350</a>]</span>already the husband
of one or more wives, is smitten at first sight with the charms of some
fair maiden. The heroine, equally susceptible, at once reciprocates his
affection, but concealing her passion, keeps her lover in agonies of
suspense. Harassed by doubts, obstacles, and delays, both are reduced
to a melancholy and emaciated condition. The somewhat doleful effect
produced by their plight is relieved by the animated doings of the
heroine&rsquo;s confidantes, but especially by the proceedings of the
court-jester (<i>vid&#363;shaka</i>), the constant companion of the
hero. He excites ridicule by his bodily defects no less than his clumsy
interference with the course of the hero&rsquo;s affairs. His attempts
at wit are, however, not of a high order. It is somewhat strange that a
character occupying the position of a universal, butt should always be
a Brahman.</p>
<p>While the Indian drama shows some affinities with Greek comedy, it
affords more striking points of resemblance to the productions of the
Elizabethan playwrights, and in particular of Shakespeare. The aim of
the Indian dramatists is not to portray types of character, but
individual persons; nor do they observe the rule of unity of time or
place. They are given to introducing romantic and fabulous elements;
they mix prose with verse; they blend the comic with the serious, and
introduce puns and comic distortions of words. The character of the
<i>vid&#363;shaka</i>, too, is a close parallel to the fool in
Shakespeare. Common to both are also several contrivances intended to
further the action of the drama, such as the writing of letters, the
introduction of a play within a play, the restoration of the dead to
life, and the use of intoxication on the stage as a humorous device.
Such a series of coincidences, in a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb351" href="#pb351" name="pb351">351</a>]</span>case where influence
or borrowing is absolutely out of the question, is an instructive
instance of how similar developments can arise independently.</p>
<p>Every Sanskrit play begins with a prologue or introduction, which
regularly opens with a prayer or benediction (<i>n&#257;nd&#299;</i>)
invoking the national deity in favour of the audience. Then generally
follows a dialogue between the stage-manager and one or two actors,
which refers to the play and its author, seeks to win public favour by
paying a complimentary tribute to the critical acumen of the
spectators, mentions past events and present circumstances elucidating
the plot, and invariably ends by adroitly introducing one of the
characters of the actual play. A Sanskrit drama is divided into scenes
and acts. The former are marked by the entrance of one character and
the exit of another. The stage is never left vacant till the end of the
act, nor does any change of locality take place till then. Before a new
act an interlude (called <i>vishkambha</i> or <i>prave&ccedil;aka</i>),
consisting of a monologue or dialogue, is often introduced. In this
scene allusion is made to events supposed to have occurred in the
interval, and the audience are prepared for what is about to take
place. The whole piece closes with a prayer for national prosperity,
which is addressed to the favourite deity and is spoken by one of the
principal characters.</p>
<p>The number of acts in a play varies from one to ten; but, while
fluctuating somewhat, is determined by the character of the drama. Thus
the species called <i>n&#257;&#7789;ik&#257;</i> has four acts and the
farcical <i>prahasana</i> only one.</p>
<p>The duration of the events is supposed to be identical with the time
occupied in performing them on the stage, or, at most, a day; and a
night is assumed to elapse <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href=
"#pb352" name="pb352">352</a>]</span>between each act and that which
follows. Occasionally, however, the interval is much longer. Thus in
K&#257;lid&#257;sa&rsquo;s <i>&Ccedil;akuntal&#257;</i> and
<i>Urva&ccedil;&#299;</i> several years pass between the first and the
last act; while in Bhavabh&#363;ti&rsquo;s
<i>Uttara-r&#257;macharita</i> no less than twelve years elapse between
the first and the second act.</p>
<p>Nor is unity of place observed; for the scene may be transferred
from one part of the earth to another, or even to the a&euml;rial
regions. Change of locality sometimes occurs even within the same act;
as when a journey is supposed to be performed through the air in a
celestial car. It is somewhat curious that while there are many and
minute stage directions about dress and decorations no less than about
the actions of the players, nothing is said in this way as to change of
scene. As regards the number of characters appearing in a play, no
limit of any kind is imposed.</p>
<p>There were no special theatres in the Indian Middle Ages, and plays
seem to have been performed in the concert-room
(<i>sam&#803;g&#299;ta-&ccedil;&#257;l&#257;</i>) of royal palaces. A
curtain divided in the middle was a necessary part of the stage
arrangement; it did not, however, separate the audience from the stage,
as in the Roman theatre, but formed the background of the stage. Behind
the curtain was the tiring-room (<i>nepathya</i>), whence the actors
came on the stage. When they were intended to enter hurriedly, they
were directed to do so &ldquo;with a toss of the curtain.&rdquo; The
stage scenery and decorations were of a very simple order, much being
left to the imagination of the spectator, as in the <span class="corr"
id="xd21e10879" title="Source: Shakespearian">Shakespearean</span>
drama. Weapons, seats, thrones, and chariots appeared on the stage; but
it is highly improbable that the latter were drawn by the living
animals supposed to be attached to them. Owing to the very <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href="#pb353" name=
"pb353">353</a>]</span>frequent intercourse between the inhabitants of
heaven and earth, there may have been some kind of a&euml;rial
contrivance to represent celestial chariots; but owing to the repeated
occurrence of the stage direction &ldquo;gesticulating&rdquo;
(<i>n&#257;&#7789;ayitv&#257;</i>) in this connection, it is to be
supposed that the impression of motion and speed was produced on the
audience simply by the gestures of the actors.</p>
<p>The best productions of the Indian drama are nearly a dozen in
number, and date from a period embracing something like four hundred
years, from about the beginning of the fifth to the end of the eighth
century A.D. These plays are the compositions of the great dramatists
K&#257;lid&#257;sa and Bhavabh&#363;ti, or have come down under the
names of the royal patrons &Ccedil;&#363;draka and
&Ccedil;r&#299;harsha, to whom their real authors attributed them.</p>
<p>The greatest of all is <span class="sc">K&#257;lid&#257;sa</span>,
already known to us as the author of several of the best K&#257;vyas.
Three of his plays have been preserved, <i>&Ccedil;akuntal&#257;,
Vikramorva&ccedil;&#299;</i>, and <i>M&#257;lavik&#257;gnimitra</i>.
The richness of creative fancy which he displays in these, and his
skill in the expression of tender feeling, assign him a high place
among the dramatists of the world. The harmony of the poetic sentiment
is nowhere disturbed by anything violent or terrifying. Every passion
is softened without being enfeebled. The ardour of love never goes
beyond &aelig;sthetic bounds; it never maddens to wild jealousy or
hate. The torments of sorrow are toned down to a profound and touching
melancholy. It was here at last that the Indian genius found the law of
moderation in poetry, which it hardly knew elsewhere, and thus produced
works of enduring beauty. Hence it was that
<i>&Ccedil;akuntal&#257;</i> exercised so great a fascination on the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb354" href="#pb354" name=
"pb354">354</a>]</span>calm intellect of Goethe, who at the same time
was so strongly repelled by the extravagances of Hindu mythological
art.</p>
<p>In comparison with the Greek and the modern drama, Nature occupies a
much more important place in Sanskrit plays. The characters are
surrounded by Nature, with which they are in constant communion. The
mango and other trees, creepers, lotuses, and pale-red trumpet-flowers,
gazelles, flamingoes, bright-hued parrots, and Indian cuckoos, in the
midst of which they move, are often addressed by them and form an
essential part of their lives. Hence the influence of Nature on the
minds of lovers is much dwelt on. Prominent everywhere in classical
Sanskrit poetry, these elements of Nature luxuriate most of all in the
drama.</p>
<p>The finest of K&#257;lid&#257;sa&rsquo;s works are, it cannot be
denied, defective as stage-plays. The very delicacy of the sentiment,
combined with a certain want of action, renders them incapable of
producing a powerful effect on an audience. The best representatives of
the romantic drama of India are <i>&Ccedil;akuntal&#257;</i> and
<i>Vikramorva&ccedil;&#299;</i>. Dealing with the love adventures of
two famous kings of ancient epic legend, they represent scenes far
removed from reality, in which heaven and earth are not separated, and
men, demigods, nymphs, and saints are intermingled.
<i>M&#257;lavik&#257;gnimitra</i>, on the other hand, not concerned
with the heroic or divine, is a palace-and-harem drama, a story of
contemporary love and intrigue.</p>
<p>The plot of <i>&Ccedil;akuntal&#257;</i> is derived from the first
book of the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>. The hero is Dushyanta, a
celebrated king of ancient days, the heroine, &Ccedil;akuntal&#257;,
the daughter of a celestial nymph, Menak&#257;, and of the sage
Vi&ccedil;v&#257;mitra; while their son, Bharata, became the founder of
a famous <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href="#pb355" name=
"pb355">355</a>]</span>race. The piece consists of seven acts, and
belongs to the class of drama by native writers on poetics styled
<i>n&#257;&#7789;aka</i>, or &ldquo;<i>the</i> play.&rdquo; In this the
plot must be taken from mythology or history, the characters must be
heroic or divine; it should be written in elaborate style, and full of
noble sentiments, with five acts at least, and not more than ten.</p>
<p>After the prelude, in which an actress sings a charming lyric on the
beauties of summer-time, King Dushyanta appears pursuing a gazelle in
the sacred grove of the sage Ka&#7751;va. Here he catches sight of
&Ccedil;akuntal&#257;, who, accompanied by her two maiden friends, is
engaged in watering her favourite trees. Struck by her beauty, he
exclaims&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">Her lip is ruddy as an opening bud.</p>
<p class="line">Her graceful arms resemble tender shoots:</p>
<p class="line">Attractive as the bloom upon the tree,</p>
<p class="line">The glow of youth is spread on all her limbs.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Seizing an opportunity of addressing her, he soon
feels that it is impossible for him to return to his capital&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">My limbs move forward, while my heart flies back,</p>
<p class="line">Like silken standard borne against the breeze.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In the second act the comic element is introduced with
the jester M&#257;&#7789;havya, who is as much disgusted with his
master&rsquo;s love-lorn condition as with his fondness for the chase.
In the third act, the love-sick &Ccedil;akuntal&#257; is discovered
lying on a bed of flowers in an arbour. The king overhears her
conversation with her two friends, shows himself, and offers to wed the
heroine. An interlude explains how a choleric ascetic, named
Durv&#257;sa, enraged at not being greeted by &Ccedil;akuntal&#257;
with due courtesy, owing to her pre-occupied state, had pronounced
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb356" href="#pb356" name=
"pb356">356</a>]</span>a curse which should cause her to be entirely
forgotten by her lover, who could recognise her only by means of a
ring.</p>
<p>The king having meanwhile married &Ccedil;akuntal&#257; and returned
home, the sage Ka&#7751;va has resolved to send her to her husband. The
way in which &Ccedil;akuntal&#257; takes leave of the sacred grove in
which she has been brought up, of her flowers, her gazelles, and her
friends, is charmingly described in the fourth act. This is the act
which contains the most obvious beauties; for here the poet displays to
the full the richness of his fancy, his abundant sympathy with Nature,
and a profound knowledge of the human heart.</p>
<p>A young Brahman pupil thus describes the dawning of the day on which
&Ccedil;akuntal&#257; is to leave the forest hermitage&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">On yonder side the moon, the Lord of Plants,</p>

</div>
<p class="first">The fifth act, in which &Ccedil;akuntal&#257; appears
before her husband, is deeply moving. The king fails to recognise her,
and, though treating her not unkindly, refuses to acknowledge her as
his wife. As a last resource, &Ccedil;akuntal&#257; bethinks herself of
the ring given her by her husband, but on discovering that it is lost,
abandons hope. She is then borne off to heaven by celestial agency.</p>
<p>In the following interlude we see a fisherman dragged along by
constables for having in his possession the royal signet-ring, which he
professes to have found inside a fish. The king, however, causes him to
be set free, rewarding him handsomely for his find. Recollection of his
former love now returns to Dushyanta. While he is indulging in sorrow
at his repudiation of &Ccedil;akuntal&#257;, M&#257;tali, Indra&rsquo;s
charioteer, appears on the scene to ask the king&rsquo;s aid in
vanquishing the demons. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb358" href=
"#pb358" name="pb358">358</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the last act Dushyanta is seen driving in Indra&rsquo;s car to
Hemak&#363;&#7789;a, the mountain of the Gandharvas. Here he sees a
young boy playing with a lion cub. Taking his hand, without knowing him
to be his own son, he exclaims&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">If now the touch of but a stranger&rsquo;s child</p>
<p class="line">Thus sends a thrill of joy through all my limbs,</p>
<p class="line">What transports must he waken in the soul</p>
<p class="line">Of that blest father from whose loins he sprang!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Soon after he finds and recognises
&Ccedil;akuntal&#257;, with whom he is at length happily reunited.</p>
<p>K&#257;lid&#257;sa&rsquo;s play has come down to us in two main
recensions. The so-called Devan&#257;gar&#299; one, shorter and more
concise, is probably the older and better. The more diffuse Bengal
recension became known first through the translation of Sir William
Jones.</p>
<p><i>Vikramorva&ccedil;&#299;</i>, or &ldquo;Urva&ccedil;&#299; won by
Valour,&rdquo; is a play in five acts, belonging to the class called
<i>Tro&#7789;aka</i>, which is described as representing events partly
terrestrial and partly celestial, and as consisting of five, seven,
eight, or nine acts. Its plot is briefly as follows. King
Pur&#363;ravas, hearing from nymphs that their companion,
Urva&ccedil;&#299;, has been carried off by demons, goes to the rescue
and brings her back on his car. He is enraptured by the beauty of the
nymph, no less than she is captivated by her deliverer.
Urva&ccedil;&#299; being summoned before the throne of Indra, the
lovers are soon obliged to part.</p>
<p>In the second act Urva&ccedil;&#299; appears for a short time to the
king as he disconsolately wanders in the garden. A letter, in which she
had written a confession of her love, is discovered by the queen, who
refuses to be pacified.</p>
<p>In the third act we learn that Urva&ccedil;&#299; had been acting
before Indra in a play representing the betrothal <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb359" href="#pb359" name="pb359">359</a>]</span>of
Lakshm&#299;, and had, when asked on whom her heart was set, named
Pur&#363;ravas instead of Purushottama (<i>i.e.</i> Vish&#7751;u). She
is consequently cursed by her teacher, Bharata, but is forgiven by
Indra, who allows her to be united with Pur&#363;ravas till the latter
sees his offspring.</p>
<p>The fourth act is peculiar in being almost entirely lyrical. The
lovers are wandering near Kail&#257;sa, the divine mountain, when
Urva&ccedil;&#299;, in a fit of jealousy, enters the grove of
Kum&#257;ra, god of war, which is forbidden to all females. In
consequence of Bharata&rsquo;s curse, she is instantly transformed into
a creeper. The king, beside himself with grief at her loss, seeks her
everywhere. He apostrophises various insects, birds, beasts, and even a
mountain peak, to tell him where she is. At last he thinks he sees her
in the mountain stream:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">The rippling wave is like her frown; the row</p>
<p class="line">Of tossing birds her girdle; streaks of foam</p>
<p class="line">Her flutt&rsquo;ring garment as she speeds along;</p>
<p class="line">The current, her devious and stumbling gait:</p>
<p class="line">&rsquo;Tis she turned in her wrath into a stream.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Finally, under the influence of a magic stone, which
has come into his possession, he clasps a creeper, which is transformed
into Urva&ccedil;&#299; in his arms.</p>
<p>Between the fourth and fifth acts several years elapse. Then
Pur&#363;ravas, by accident, discovers his son &#256;yus, whom
Urva&ccedil;&#299; had secretly borne, and had caused to be brought up
in a hermitage. Urva&ccedil;&#299; must therefore return to heaven.
Indra, however, in return for Pur&#363;ravas&rsquo; services against
the demons, makes a new concession, and allows the nymph to remain with
the king for good.</p>
<p>There are two recensions of this play also, one of them belonging to
Southern India.</p>
<p>The doubts long entertained, on the ground of its <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360" name=
"pb360">360</a>]</span>inferiority and different character, as to
whether <i>M&#257;lavik&#257;gnimitra</i>, or &ldquo;M&#257;lavik&#257;
and Agnimitra,&rdquo; is really the work of K&#257;lid&#257;sa, who is
mentioned in the prologue as the author, are hardly justified. The
piece has been shown by Weber to agree pretty closely in thought and
diction with the two other plays of the poet; and though certainly not
equal to the latter in poetic merit, it possesses many beauties. The
subject is not heroic or divine, the plot being derived from the
ordinary palace life of Indian princes, and thus supplying a peculiarly
good picture of the social conditions of the times. The hero is a
historical king of the dynasty of the &Ccedil;ungas, who reigned at
Vidi&ccedil;&#257; (Bhilsa) in the second century B.C. The play
describes the loves of this king Agnimitra and of M&#257;lavik&#257;,
one of the attendants of the queen, who jealously keeps her out of the
king&rsquo;s sight on account of her great beauty. The various
endeavours of the king to see and converse with M&#257;lavik&#257; give
rise to numerous little intrigues. In the course of these Agnimitra
nowhere appears as a despot, but acts with much delicate consideration
for the feelings of his spouses. It finally turns out that
M&#257;lavik&#257; is by birth a princess, who had only come to be an
attendant at Agnimitra&rsquo;s court through having fallen into the
hands of robbers. There being now no objection to her union with the
king, all ends happily.</p>
<p>While K&#257;lid&#257;sa stands highest in poetical refinement, in
tenderness, and depth of feeling, the author of the
<i>M&#7771;icchaka&#7789;ik&#257;</i>, or &ldquo;Clay Cart,&rdquo; is
pre-eminent among Indian playwrights for the distinctively dramatic
qualities of vigour, life, and action, no less than sharpness of
characterisation, being thus allied in genius to Shakespeare. This play
is also marked by originality and good sense. Attributed to a king
named &Ccedil;&#363;draka, who is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb361"
href="#pb361" name="pb361">361</a>]</span>panegyrised in the prologue,
it is probably the work of a poet patronised by him, perhaps
Da&#7751;&#7693;in, as Professor Pischel thinks. In any case, it not
improbably belongs to the sixth century. It is divided into ten acts,
and belongs to the dramatic class called <i>prakara&#7751;a</i>. The
name has little to do with the play, being derived from an unimportant
episode of the sixth act. The scene is laid in Ujjayin&#299; and its
neighbourhood. The number of characters appearing on the stage is very
considerable. The chief among them are Ch&#257;rudatta, a Brahman
merchant who has lost all his property by excessive liberality, and
Vasantasen&#257;, a rich courtesan who loves the poor but noble
Ch&#257;rudatta, and ultimately becomes his wife. The third act
contains a humorous account of a burglary, in which stealing is treated
as a fine art. In the fourth act there is a detailed description of the
splendours of Vasantasen&#257;&rsquo;s palace. Though containing much
exaggeration, it furnishes an interesting picture of the kind of luxury
that prevailed in those days. Altogether this play abounds in comic
situations, besides containing many serious scenes, some of which even
border on the tragic.</p>
<p>To the first half of the seventh century belong the two dramas
attributed to the famous King &Ccedil;r&#299;harsha or Harshadeva, a
patron of poets, whom we already know as Harshavardhana of
Th&#257;ne&ccedil;ar and Kanauj. <i>Ratn&#257;val&#299;</i>, or
&ldquo;The Pearl Necklace,&rdquo; reflecting the court and harem life
of the age, has many points of similarity with
K&#257;lid&#257;sa&rsquo;s <i>M&#257;lavik&#257;gnimitra</i>, by which,
indeed, its plot was probably suggested. It is the story of the loves
of Udayana, king of Vatsa, and of S&#257;garik&#257;, an attendant of
his queen V&#257;savadatt&#257;. The heroine ultimately turns out to be
Ratn&#257;val&#299;, princess of Ceylon, who had found her way to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb362" href="#pb362" name=
"pb362">362</a>]</span>Udayana&rsquo;s court after suffering shipwreck.
The plot is unconnected with mythology, but is based on an historical
or epic tradition, which recurs in a somewhat different form in
Somadeva&rsquo;s <i>Kath&#257;sarits&#257;gara</i>. As concerned with
the second marriage of the king, it forms a sequel to the popular
love-story of V&#257;savadatt&#257;. It is impossible to say whether
the poet modified the main outlines of the traditional story, but the
character of the magician who conjures up a vision of the gods and a
conflagration, is his invention, as well as the incidents, which are of
an entirely domestic nature. The real author was doubtless some poet
resident at &Ccedil;r&#299;harsha&rsquo;s court, possibly
B&#257;&#7751;a, who also wrote a play entitled
<i>P&#257;rvat&#299;pari&#7751;aya</i>.</p>
<p>Altogether, <i>Ratn&#257;val&#299;</i> is an agreeable play, with
well-drawn characters and many poetical beauties. Of the latter the
following lines, in which the king describes the pale light in the east
heralding the rise of the moon, may serve as a specimen:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">Our minds intent upon the festival,</p>
<p class="line">We saw not that the twilight passed away:</p>
<p class="line">Behold, the east proclaims the lord of night</p>
<p class="line">Still hidden by the mountain where he rises,</p>
<p class="line">Even as a maiden by her pale face shows</p>
<p class="line">That in her inmost heart a lover dwells.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Another play of considerable merit attributed to
&Ccedil;r&#299;harsha is <i>N&#257;g&#257;nanda</i>. It is a
sensational piece with a Buddhistic colouring, the hero being a
Buddhist and Buddha being praised in the introductory benediction. For
this reason its author was probably different from that of
<i>Ratn&#257;val&#299;</i>, and may have been Dh&#257;vaka, who, like
B&#257;&#7751;a, is known to have lived at the court of
&Ccedil;r&#299;harsha.</p>
<p>The dramatist <span class="sc">Bhavabh&#363;ti</span> was a Brahman
of the Taittir&#299;ya school of the <i>Yajurveda</i> and belonged, as
we <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb363" href="#pb363" name=
"pb363">363</a>]</span>learn from his prologues, to Vidarbha (now
Berar) in Southern India. He knew the city of Ujjayin&#299; well, and
probably spent at least a part of his life there. His patron was King
Ya&ccedil;ovarman of K&#257;nyakubja (Kanauj), who ruled during the
first half of the eighth century.</p>
<p>Three plays by this poet, all abounding in poetic beauties, have
come down to us. They contrast in two or three respects with the works
of the earlier dramatists. The absence of the character of the jester
is characteristic of them, the comic and witty element entering into
them only to a slight extent. While other Indian poets dwell on the
delicate and mild beauties of Nature, Bhavabh&#363;ti loves to depict
her grand and sublime aspects, doubtless owing to the influence on his
mind of the southern mountains of his native land. He is, moreover,
skilful not only in drawing characters inspired by tender and noble
sentiment, but in giving effective expression to depth and force of
passion.</p>
<p>The best known and most popular of Bhavabh&#363;ti&rsquo;s plays is
<i>M&#257;lat&#299;-m&#257;dhava</i>, a <i>prakara&#7751;a</i> in ten
acts. The scene is laid in Ujjayin&#299;, and the subject is the
love-story of M&#257;lat&#299;, daughter of a minister of the country,
and M&#257;dhava, a young scholar studying in the city, and son of the
minister of another state. Skilfully interwoven with this main story
are the fortunes of Makaranda, a friend of M&#257;dhava, and
Madayantik&#257;, a sister of the king&rsquo;s favourite.
M&#257;lat&#299; and M&#257;dhava meet and fall in love; but the king
has determined that the heroine shall marry his favourite, whom she
detests. This plan is frustrated by Makaranda, who, personating
M&#257;lat&#299;, goes through the wedding ceremony with the
bridegroom. The lovers, aided in their projects by two amiable Buddhist
nuns, are finally united. The piece is a sort of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb364" href="#pb364" name=
"pb364">364</a>]</span>Indian <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> with a happy
ending, the part played by the nun K&#257;mandak&#299; being analogous
to that of Friar Laurence in Shakespeare&rsquo;s drama. The contrast
produced by scenes of tender love, and the horrible doings of the
priestess of the dread goddess Durg&#257;, is certainly effective, but
perhaps too violent. The use made of swoons, from which the recovery
is, however, very rapid, is rather too common in this play.</p>
<p>The ninth act contains several fine passages describing the scenery
of the Vindhya range. The following is a translation of one of
them:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">This mountain with its towering rocks delights</p>
<p class="line">The eye: its peaks grow dark with gathering clouds;</p>
<p class="line">Its groves are thronged with peacocks eloquent</p>
<p class="line">In joy; the trees upon its slopes are bright</p>
<p class="line">With birds that flit about their nests; the caves</p>
<p class="line">Reverberate the growl of bears; the scent</p>
<p class="line">Of incense-trees is wafted, sharp and cool,</p>
<p class="line">From branches broken off by elephants.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The other two dramas of Bhavabh&#363;ti represent the
fortunes of the same national hero, R&#257;ma. The plot of the
<i>Mah&#257;v&#299;ra-charita</i>, or &ldquo;The Fortunes of the Great
Hero,&rdquo; varies but slightly from the story told in the
<i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i>. The play, which is divided into seven
acts and is crowded with characters, concludes with the coronation of
R&#257;ma. The last act illustrates well how much is left to the
imagination of the spectator. It represents the journey of R&#257;ma in
an a&euml;rial car from Ceylon all the way to Ayodhy&#257; (Oudh) in
Northern India, the scenes traversed being described by one of the
company.</p>
<p>The <i>Uttara-r&#257;ma-charita</i>, or &ldquo;The Later Fortunes of
R&#257;ma,&rdquo; is a romantic piece containing many fine passages.
Owing to lack of action, however, it is rather a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb365" href="#pb365" name=
"pb365">365</a>]</span>dramatic poem than a play. The description of
the tender love of R&#257;ma and S&#299;t&#257;, purified by sorrow,
exhibits more genuine pathos than appears perhaps in any other Indian
drama. The play begins with the banishment of S&#299;t&#257; and ends
with her restoration, after twelve years of grievous solitude, to the
throne of Ayodhy&#257; amid popular acclamations. Her two sons, born
after her banishment and reared in the wilderness by the sage
V&#257;lm&#299;ki, without any knowledge of their royal descent,
furnish a striking parallel to the two princes Guiderius and Arviragus
who are brought up by the hermit Belarius in Shakespeare&rsquo;s
<i>Cymbeline</i>. The scene in which their meeting with their father
R&#257;ma is described reaches a high degree of poetic merit.</p>
<p>Among the works of other dramatists, <span class=
"sc">Vi&ccedil;&#257;khadatta&rsquo;s</span>
<i>Mudr&#257;-r&#257;kshasa</i>, or &ldquo;R&#257;kshasa and the
Seal,&rdquo; deserves special mention because of its unique character.
For, unlike all the other dramas hitherto described, it is a play of
political intrigue, composed, moreover, with much dramatic talent,
being full of life, action, and sustained interest. Nothing more
definite can be said as to its date than that it was probably written
not later than about 800 A.D. The action of the piece takes place in
the time of Chandragupta, who, soon after Alexander&rsquo;s invasion of
India, founded a new dynasty at P&#257;&#7789;aliputra by deposing the
last king of the Nanda line. R&#257;kshasa, the minister of the latter,
refusing to recognise the usurper, endeavours to be avenged on him for
the ruin of his late master. The plot turns on the efforts of the
Brahman Ch&#257;&#7751;akya, the minister of Chandragupta, to win over
the noble R&#257;kshasa to his master&rsquo;s cause. In this he is
ultimately successful.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Bha&#7789;&#7789;a
N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a&rsquo;s</span>
<i>Ve&#7751;&#299;sam&#803;h&#257;ra</i>, or &ldquo;Binding of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366" name=
"pb366">366</a>]</span>braid of hair,&rdquo; is a play in six acts,
deriving its plot from the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>. Its action
turns on the incident of Draupad&#299; being dragged by the hair of her
head into the assembly by one of the brothers of Duryodhana. Its age is
known from its author having been the grantee of a copperplate dated
840 A.D. Though not conspicuous for poetic merit, it has long been a
great favourite in India owing to its express partiality for the cult
of K&#7771;ish&#7751;a.</p>
<p>To about 900 A.D. belongs the poet <span class=
"sc">R&#257;ja&ccedil;ekhara</span>, the distinguishing feature of
whose dramas are lightness and grace of diction. Four of his plays have
survived, and are entitled <i>Viddha-&ccedil;&#257;labhanjik&#257;</i>,
<i>Karp&#363;ra-manjar&#299;</i>,
<i>B&#257;la-r&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i>, and
<i>Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a-p&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ava</i> or
<i>B&#257;la-bh&#257;rata</i>.</p>
<p>The poet <span class="sc">Kshem&#299;&ccedil;vara</span>, who
probably lived in the tenth century A.D. at K&#257;nyakubja under King
Mah&#299;p&#257;la, is the author of a play named
<i>Cha&#7751;&#7693;akau&ccedil;ika</i>, or &ldquo;The Angry
Kau&ccedil;ika.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the eleventh century <span class="sc">D&#257;modara
Mi&ccedil;ra</span> composed the <i>Hanuman-n&#257;&#7789;aka</i>,
&ldquo;The Play of Hanumat,&rdquo; also called
<i>Mah&#257;-n&#257;&#7789;aka</i>, or &ldquo;The Great Play.&rdquo;
According to tradition, he lived at the court of Bhoja, king of
M&#257;lava, who resided at Dh&#257;r&#257; (now Dh&#257;r) and
Ujjayin&#299; (Ujjain) in the early part of the eleventh century. It is
a piece of little merit, dealing with the story of R&#257;ma in
connection with his ally Hanumat, the monkey chief. It consists of
fourteen acts, lacking coherence, and producing the impression of
fragments patched together.</p>
<p><span class="sc">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a mi&ccedil;ra&rsquo;s</span>
<i>Prabodha-chandrodaya</i>, or &ldquo;Rise of the Moon of
Knowledge,&rdquo; a play in six acts, dating from about the end of the
eleventh century, deserves special attention as one of the most
remarkable products of Indian literature. Though an allegorical piece
of theologico-philosophical purport, in which practically only
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href="#pb367" name=
"pb367">367</a>]</span>abstract notions and symbolical figures act as
persons, it is remarkable for dramatic life and vigour. It aims at
glorifying orthodox Brahmanism in the Vishnuite sense, just as the
allegorical plays of the Spanish poet Calderon were intended to exalt
the Catholic faith. The Indian poet has succeeded in the difficult task
of creating an attractive play with abstractions like Revelation, Will,
Reason, Religion, by transforming them into living beings of flesh and
blood. The evil King Error appears on the scene as ruler of Benares,
surrounded by his faithful adherents, the Follies and Vices, while
Religion and the noble King Reason, accompanied by all the Virtues,
have been banished. There is, however, a prophecy that Reason will some
day be re-united with Revelation; the fruit of the union will be True
Knowledge, which will destroy the reign of Error. The struggle for this
union and its consummation, followed by the final triumph of the good
party, forms the plot of the piece.</p>
<p>A large number of Sanskrit plays have been written since the twelfth
century<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11280src" href="#xd21e11280" name=
"xd21e11280src">1</a> down to modern times, their plots being generally
derived from the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> and the
<i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i>. Besides these, there are farces in one
or more acts, mostly of a coarse type, in which various vices, such as
hypocrisy, are satirised. These later productions reach a much lower
level of art than the works of the early Indian dramatists.

<h2 class="main">Fairy Tales and Fables</h2>
<h2 class="sub">(<i>Circa</i> 400&ndash;1100 A.D.)</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The didactic and sententious note which prevails in
classical Sanskrit literature cannot fail to strike the student. It is,
however, specially pronounced in the fairy tales and fables, where the
abundant introduction of ethical reflections and proverbial philosophy
is characteristic. The apologue with its moral is peculiarly subject to
this method of treatment.</p>
<p>A distinguishing feature of the Sanskrit collections of fairy tales
and fables, which are to a considerable extent found mixed together, is
the insertion of a number of different stories within the framework of
a single narrative. The characters of the main story in turn relate
various tales to edify one another or to prove the correctness of their
own special views. As within the limits of a minor story a second one
can be similarly introduced and the process further repeated, the
construction of the whole work comes to resemble that of a set of
Chinese boxes. This style of narration was borrowed from India by the
neighbouring Oriental peoples of Persia and Arabia, who employed it in
composing independent works. The most notable instance is, of course,
the <i>Arabian Nights</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Panchatantra</i>, so called because it is divided
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href="#pb369" name=
"pb369">369</a>]</span>into five books, is, from the literary point of
view, the most important and interesting work in this branch of Indian
literature. It consists for the most part of fables, which are written
in prose with an admixture of illustrative aphoristic verse. At what
time this collection first assumed definite shape, it is impossible to
say. We know, however, that it existed in the first half of the sixth
century A.D., since it was translated by order of King Khosru
Anush&#299;rvan (531&ndash;79) into Pehlev&#299;, the literary language
of Persia at that time. We may, indeed, assume that it was known in the
fifth century; for a considerable time must have elapsed before it
became so famous that a foreign king desired its translation.</p>
<p>If not actually a Buddhistic work, the <i>Panchatantra</i> must be
derived from Buddhistic sources. This follows from the fact that a
number of its fables can be traced to Buddhistic writings, and from the
internal evidence of the book itself. Apologues and fables were current
among the Buddhists from the earliest times. They were ascribed to
Buddha, and their sanctity increased by identifying the best character
in any story with Buddha himself in a previous birth. Hence such tales
were called <i>J&#257;takas</i>, or &ldquo;Birth Stories.&rdquo; There
is evidence that a collection of stories under that name existed as
early as the Council of Ves&#257;l&#299;, about 380 B.C.; and in the
fifth century A.D. they assumed the shape they now have in the
P&#257;li <i>Sutta-pi&#7789;aka</i>. Moreover, two Chinese
encylop&aelig;dias, the older of which was completed in 668 A.D.,
contain a large number of Indian fables translated into Chinese, and
cite no fewer than 202 Buddhist works as their sources. In its present
form, however, the <i>Panchatantra</i> is the production of Brahmans,
who, though they transformed or omitted <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb370" href="#pb370" name="pb370">370</a>]</span>such parts as
betrayed animus against Brahmanism, have nevertheless left uneffaced
many traces of the Buddhistic origin of the collection. Though now
divided into only five books, it is shown by the evidence of the oldest
translation to have at one time embraced twelve. What its original name
was we cannot say, but it may not improbably have been called after the
two jackals, Kara&#7789;aka and Damanaka, who play a prominent part in
the first book; for the title of the old Syriac version is <i>Kalilag
and Damnag</i>, and that of the Arabic translation <i>Kal&#299;lah and
Dimnah</i>.</p>
<p>Originally the <i>Panchatantra</i> was probably intended to be a
manual for the instruction of the sons of kings in the principles of
conduct (<i>n&#299;ti</i>), a kind of &ldquo;Mirror of Princes.&rdquo;
For it is introduced with the story of King Amara&ccedil;akti of
Mahil&#257;ropya, a city of the south, who wishes to discover a scholar
capable of training his three stupid and idle sons. He at last finds a
Brahman who undertakes to teach the princes in six months enough to
make them surpass all others in knowledge of moral science. This object
he duly accomplishes by composing the <i>Panchatantra</i> and reciting
it to the young princes.</p>
<p>The framework of the first book, entitled &ldquo;Separation of
Friends,&rdquo; is the story of a bull and a lion, who are introduced
to one another in the forest by two jackals and become fast friends.
One of the jackals, feeling himself neglected, starts an intrigue by
telling both the lion and the bull that each is plotting against the
other. As a result the bull is killed in battle with the lion, and the
jackal, as prime minister of the latter, enjoys the fruits of his
machinations. The main story of the second book, which is called
&ldquo;Acquisition <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb371" href="#pb371"
name="pb371">371</a>]</span>of Friends,&rdquo; deals with the
adventures of a tortoise, a deer, a crow, and a mouse. It is meant to
illustrate the advantages of judicious friendships. The third book, or
&ldquo;The War of the Crows and the Owls,&rdquo; points out the danger
of friendship concluded between those who are old enemies. The fourth
book, entitled &ldquo;Loss of what has been Acquired,&rdquo;
illustrates, by the main story of the monkey and the crocodile, how
fools can be made by flattery to part with their possessions. The fifth
book, entitled &ldquo;Inconsiderate Action,&rdquo; contains a number of
stories connected with the experiences of a barber, who came to grief
through failing to take all the circumstances of the case into
consideration.</p>
<p>The book is pervaded by a quaint humour which transfers, to the
animal kingdom all sorts of human action. Thus animals devote
themselves to the study of the Vedas and to the practice of religious
rites; they engage in disquisitions about gods, saints, and heroes; or
exchange views regarding subtle rules of ethics; but suddenly their
fierce animal nature breaks out. A pious cat, for instance, called upon
to act as umpire in a dispute between a sparrow and a monkey, inspires
such confidence in the litigants, by a long discourse on the vanity of
life and the supreme importance of virtue, that they come close up in
order to hear better the words of wisdom. In an instant he seizes one
of the disputants with his claws, the other with his teeth, and devours
them both. Very humorous is the story of the conceited musical donkey.
Trespassing one moonlight night in a cucumber field, he feels impelled
to sing, and answers the objections of his friend the jackal by a
lecture on the charms of music. He then begins to bray, arouses the
watchmen, and receives a sound drubbing. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb372" href="#pb372" name="pb372">372</a>]</span></p>
<p>With abundant irony and satire the most various human vices are
exposed, among others the hypocrisy and avarice of Brahmans, the
intriguing character of courtiers, and the faithlessness of women. A
vigorous popular spirit of reaction against Brahman pretensions here
finds expression, and altogether a sound and healthy view of life
prevails, forming a refreshing contrast to the exaggeration found in
many branches of Indian literature.</p>
<p>The following translation of a short fable from the first book may
serve as a specimen of the style of the <i>Panchatantra</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was in a certain forest region a herd of monkeys. Once
in the winter season, when their bodies were shivering from contact
with the cold wind, and were buffeted with torrents of rain, they could
find no rest. So some of the monkeys, collecting <i>gunja</i> berries,
which are like sparks, stood round blowing in order to obtain a fire.
Now a bird named Needlebeak, seeing this vain endeavour of theirs,
exclaimed, &lsquo;Ho, you are all great fools; these are not sparks of
fire, they are <i>gunja</i> berries. Why, therefore, this vain
endeavour? You will never protect yourselves against the cold in this
way. You had better look for a spot in the forest which is sheltered
from the wind, or a cave, or a cleft in the mountains. Even now mighty
rain clouds are appearing.&rsquo; Thereupon an old monkey among them
said, &lsquo;Ho, what business of yours is this? Be off. There is a
saying&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">A man of judgment who desires</p>
<p class="line">His own success should not accost</p>
<p class="line">One constantly disturbed in work</p>
<p class="line">Or gamblers who have lost at play.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb373" href="#pb373" name=
"pb373">373</a>]</span></p>
<p>And another&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">Who joins in conversation with</p>
<p class="line">A hunter who has chased in vain,</p>
<p class="line">Or with a fool who has become</p>
<p class="line">Involved in ruin, comes to grief.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The bird, however, without paying any attention
to him, continually said to the monkeys, &lsquo;Ho, why this vain
endeavour?&rsquo; So, as he did not for a moment cease to chatter, one
of the monkeys, enraged at their futile efforts, seized him by the
wings and dashed him against a stone. And so he (de)ceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hence I say&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">Unbending wood cannot be bent,</p>
<p class="line">A razor cannot cut a stone:</p>
<p class="line">Mark this, O Needlebeak! Try not</p>
<p class="line">To lecture him who will not learn.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">A similar collection of fables is the celebrated
<i>Hitopade&ccedil;a</i>, or &ldquo;Salutary Advice,&rdquo; which,
owing to its intrinsic merit, is one of the best known and most popular
works of Sanskrit literature in India, and which, because of its
suitability for teaching purposes, is read by nearly all beginners of
Sanskrit in England. It is based chiefly on the <i>Panchatantra</i>, in
which twenty-five of its forty-three fables are found. The first three
books of the older collection have been, in the main, drawn upon; for
there is but one story, that of the ass in the tiger&rsquo;s skin,
taken from Book IV., and only three from Book V. The introduction is
similar to that of the <i>Panchatantra</i>, but the father of the
ignorant and vicious princes is here called Sudar&ccedil;ana of
P&#257;&#7789;aliputra (Patna). The <i>Hitopade&ccedil;a</i> is divided
into four books. The framework and titles of the first two agree with
the first two of the <i>Panchatantra</i>, but in inverted order. The
third and fourth books are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb374" href=
"#pb374" name="pb374">374</a>]</span>called &ldquo;War&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Peace&rdquo; respectively, the main story describing the
conflict and reconciliation of the Geese and the Peacocks.</p>
<p>The sententious element is here much more prominent than in the
<i>Panchatantra</i>, and the number of verses introduced is often so
great as to seriously impede the progress of the prose narrative. These
verses, however, abound in wise maxims and fine thoughts. The stanzas
dealing with the transitoriness of human life near the end of Book IV.
have a peculiarly pensive beauty of their own. The following two may
serve as specimens:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">As on the mighty ocean&rsquo;s waves</p>
<p class="line">Two floating logs together come,</p>
<p class="line">And, having met, for ever part:</p>
<p class="line">So briefly joined are living things.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">As streams of rivers onward flow,</p>
<p class="line">And never more return again:</p>
<p class="line">So day and night still bear away</p>
<p class="line">The life of every mortal man.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">It is uncertain who was the author of the
<i>Hitopade&ccedil;a</i>; nor can anything more definite be said about
the date of this compilation than that it is more than 500 years old,
as the earliest known <span class="sc">MS.</span> of it was written in
1373 A.D.</p>
<p>As both the <i>Panchatantra</i> and the <i>Hitopade&ccedil;a</i>
were originally intended as manuals for the instruction of kings in
domestic and foreign policy, they belong to the class of literature
which the Hindus call <i>n&#299;ti-&ccedil;&#257;stra</i>, or
&ldquo;Science of Political Ethics.&rdquo; A purely metrical treatise,
dealing directly with the principles of policy, is the
<i>N&#299;ti-s&#257;ra</i>, or &ldquo;Essence of Conduct.&rdquo; of
K&#257;mandaka, which is one of the sources of the maxims introduced by
the author of the <i>Hitopade&ccedil;a</i>. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb375" href="#pb375" name="pb375">375</a>]</span></p>
<p>A collection of pretty and ingenious fairy tales, with a highly
Oriental colouring, is the
<i>Vet&#257;la-panchavim&#803;&ccedil;ati</i>, or &ldquo;Twenty-five
Tales of the Vet&#257;la&rdquo; (a demon supposed to occupy corpses).
The framework of this collection is briefly as follows. King Vikrama of
Ujjayin&#299; is directed by an ascetic (<i>yogin</i>) to take down
from a tree and convey a corpse, without uttering a single word, to a
spot in a graveyard where certain rites for the attainment of high
magical powers are to take place. As the king is carrying the corpse
along on his shoulders, a Vet&#257;la, which has entered it, begins to
speak and tells him a fairy tale. On the king inadvertently replying to
a question, the corpse at once disappears and is found hanging on the
tree again. The king goes back to fetch it, and the same process is
repeated till the Vet&#257;la has told twenty-five tales. Each of these
is so constructed as to end in a subtle problem, on which the king is
asked to express his opinion. The stories contained in this work are
known to many English readers under the title of <i>Vikram and the
Vampire</i>.</p>
<p>Another collection of fairy tales is the
<i>Sim&#803;h&#257;sana-dv&#257;trim&#803;&ccedil;ik&#257;</i>, or
&ldquo;Thirty-two Stories of the Lion-seat&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> throne),
which also goes by the name of <i>Vikrama-charita</i>, or
&ldquo;Adventures of Vikrama.&rdquo; Here it is the throne of King
Vikrama that tells the tales. Both this and the preceding collection
are of Buddhistic origin.</p>
<p>A third work of the same kind is the <i>&Ccedil;uka-saptati</i>, or
&ldquo;Seventy Stories of a Parrot.&rdquo; Here a wife, whose husband
is travelling abroad, and who is inclined to run after other men, turns
to her husband&rsquo;s clever parrot for advice. The bird, while
seeming to approve of her plans, warns her of the risks she runs, and
makes her promise not to go and meet any paramour unless <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb376" href="#pb376" name="pb376">376</a>]</span>she
can extricate herself from difficulties as So-and-so did. Requested to
tell the story, he does so, but only as far as the dilemma, when he
asks the woman what course the person concerned should take. As she
cannot guess, the parrot promises to tell her if she stays at home that
night. Seventy days pass in the same way, till the husband returns.</p>
<p>These three collections of fairy tales are all written in prose and
are comparatively short. There is, however, another of special
importance, which is composed in verse and is of very considerable
length. For it contains no less than 22,000 <i>&ccedil;lokas</i>, equal
to nearly one-fourth of the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>, or to almost
twice as much as the Iliad and Odyssey put together. This is the
<i>Kath&#257;-sarit-s&#257;gara</i>, or &ldquo;Ocean of Rivers of
Stories.&rdquo; It is divided into 124 chapters, called
<i>tarangas</i>, or &ldquo;waves,&rdquo; to be in keeping with the
title of the work. Independent of these is another division into
eighteen books called <i>lambakas</i>.</p>
<p>The author was <span class="sc">Somadeva</span>, a Kashmirian poet,
who composed his work about 1070 A.D. Though he himself was a Brahman,
his work contains not only many traces of the Buddhistic character of
his sources, but even direct allusions to Buddhist Birth Stories. He
states the real basis of his work to have been the
<i>B&#7771;ihat-kath&#257;</i>, or &ldquo;Great Narration,&rdquo; which
B&#257;&#7751;a mentions, by the poet Gu&#7751;&#257;dhya, who is
quoted by Da&#7751;&#7693;in. This original must, in the opinion of
B&uuml;hler, go back to the first or second century A.D.</p>
<p>A somewhat earlier recast of this work was made about A.D. 1037 by a
contemporary of Somadeva&rsquo;s named <span class="sc">Kshemendra
Vy&#257;sad&#257;sa</span>. It is entitled
<i>B&#7771;ihat-kath&#257;-manjar&#299;</i>, and is only about
one-third as long as the <i>Kath&#257;-sarit-s&#257;gara</i>.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb377" href="#pb377" name=
"pb377">377</a>]</span>Kshemendra and Somadeva worked independently of
each other, and both state that the original from which they translated
was written in the <i>pai&ccedil;&#257;ch&#299; bh&#257;sh&#257;</i> or
&ldquo;Goblin language,&rdquo; a term applied to a number of Low
Pr&#257;krit dialects spoken by the most ignorant and degraded classes.
The <i>Kath&#257;-sarit-s&#257;gara</i> also contains (<i>Tarangas</i>
60&ndash;64) a recast of the first three books of the
<i>Panchatantra</i>, which books, it is interesting to find, had the
same form in Somadeva&rsquo;s time as when they were translated into
Pehlev&#299; (about 570 A.D.).</p>
<p>Somadeva&rsquo;s work contains many most entertaining stories; for
instance, that of the king who, through ignorance of the phonetic rules
of Sanskrit grammar, misunderstood a remark made by his wife, and
overcome with shame, determined to become a good Sanskrit scholar or
die in the attempt. One of the most famous tales it contains is that of
King &Ccedil;ibi, who offered up his life to save a pigeon from a hawk.
It is a <i>J&#257;taka</i>, and is often represented on Buddhist
sculptures; for example, on the tope of Amar&#257;vat&#299;, which
dates from about the beginning of our era. It also occurs in a Chinese
as well as a Muhammadan form.</p>

<h3 class="main">Ethical Poetry.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The proneness of the Indian mind to reflection not
only produced important results in religion, philosophy, and science;
it also found a more abundant expression in poetry than the literature
of any other nation can boast. Scattered throughout the most various
departments of Sanskrit literature are innumerable apophthegms in which
wise and noble, striking and original thoughts often appear in a highly
finished and poetical garb. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb378" href=
"#pb378" name="pb378">378</a>]</span>These are plentiful in the
law-books; in the epic and the drama they are frequently on the lips of
heroes, sages, and gods; and in fables are constantly uttered by
tigers, jackals, cats, and other animals. Above all, the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>, which, to the pious Hindu, constitutes a
moral encyclop&aelig;dia, is an inexhaustible mine of proverbial
philosophy. It is, however, natural that ethical maxims should be
introduced in greatest abundance into works which, like the
<i>Panchatantra</i> and <i>Hitopade&ccedil;a</i>, were intended to be
handbooks of practical moral philosophy.</p>
<p>Owing to the universality of this mode of expression in Sanskrit
literature, there are but few works consisting exclusively of poetical
aphorisms. The most important are the two collections by the
highly-gifted Bhart&#7771;ihari, entitled respectively
<i>N&#299;ti&ccedil;ataka</i>, or &ldquo;Century of Conduct,&rdquo; and
<i>Vair&#257;gya-&ccedil;ataka</i>, or &ldquo;Century of
Renunciation.&rdquo; Others are the
<i>&Ccedil;&#257;nti-&ccedil;ataka</i>, or &ldquo;Century of
Tranquillity,&rdquo; by a Kashmirian poet named &Ccedil;ilha&#7751;a;
the <i>Moha-mudgara</i>, or &ldquo;Hammer of Folly,&rdquo; a short poem
commending the relinquishment of worldly desires, and wrongly
attributed to &Ccedil;ankar&#257;ch&#257;rya; and the
<i>Ch&#257;&#7751;akya-&ccedil;ataka</i>, the &ldquo;Centuries of
Ch&#257;&#7751;akya,&rdquo; the reputed author of which was famous in
India as a master of diplomacy, and is the leading character in the
political drama <i>Mudr&#257;-r&#257;kshasa</i>. The
<i>N&#299;ti-manjar&#299;</i>, or &ldquo;Cluster of Blossoms of
Conduct,&rdquo; which has not yet been published, is a collection of a
peculiar kind. The moral maxims which it contains are illustrated by
stories, and these are taken exclusively from the <i>Rigveda</i>. It
consists of about 200 <i>&ccedil;lokas</i>, and was composed by an
author named Dy&#257; Dviveda who accompanied his work with a
commentary. In the latter he quotes largely from the
<i>B&#7771;ih&aring;ddevat&#257;</i>, S&#257;ya&#7751;a on the
<i>Rigveda</i>, and other authors. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb379"
href="#pb379" name="pb379">379</a>]</span></p>
<p>There are also some modern anthologies of Sanskrit gnomic poetry.
One of these is &Ccedil;r&#299;dharad&#257;sa&rsquo;s
<i>Sadukti-kar&#7751;&#257;m&#7771;ita</i>, or &ldquo;Ear-nectar of
Good Maxims,&rdquo; containing quotations from 446 poets, mostly of
Bengal, and compiled in 1205 A.D. The
<i>&Ccedil;&#257;rngadhara-paddhati</i>, or &ldquo;Anthology of
&Ccedil;&#257;rngadhara,&rdquo; dating from the fourteenth century,
comprises about 6000 stanzas culled from 264 authors. The
<i>Subh&#257;shit&#257;val&#299;</i>, or &ldquo;Series of Fine
Sayings,&rdquo; compiled by Vallabhadeva, contains some 3500 stanzas
taken from about 350 poets. All that is best in Sanskrit sententious
poetry has been collected by Dr. B&ouml;htlingk, the Nestor of
Indianists, in his <i lang="de">Indische Spr&uuml;che</i>. This work
contains the text, critically edited and accompanied by a prose German
translation, of nearly 8000 stanzas, which are culled from the whole
field of classical Sanskrit literature and arranged according to the
alphabetical order of the initial word.</p>
<p>Though composed in P&#257;li, the <i>Dhammapada</i> may perhaps be
mentioned here. It is a collection of aphorisms representing the most
beautiful, profound, and poetical thoughts in Buddhist literature.</p>
<p>The keynote prevailing in all this poetry is the doctrine of the
vanity of human life, which was developed before the rise of Buddhism
in the sixth century B.C., and has dominated Indian thought ever since.
There is no true happiness, we are here taught, but in the abandonment
of desire and retirement from the world. The poet sees the luxuriant
beauties of nature spread before his eyes, and feels their charm; but
he turns from them sad and disappointed to seek mental calm and lasting
happiness in the solitude of the forest. Hence the picture of a pious
anchorite living in contemplation is often painted with enthusiasm.
Free from all desires, he is as happy <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb380" href="#pb380" name="pb380">380</a>]</span>as a king, when the
earth is his couch, his arms his pillow, the sky his tent, the moon his
lamp, when renunciation is his spouse, and the cardinal points are the
maidens that fan him with winds. No Indian poet inculcates renunciation
more forcibly than Bhart&#7771;ihari; the humorous and ironical touches
which he occasionally introduces are doubtless due to the character of
this remarkable man, who wavered between the spiritual and the worldly
life throughout his career.</p>
<p>Renunciation is not, however, the only goal to which the
transitoriness of worldly goods leads the gnomic poets of India. The
necessity of pursuing virtue is the practical lesson which they also
draw from the vanity of mundane existence, and which finds expression
in many noble admonitions:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">Transient indeed is human life,</p>
<p class="line">Like the moon&rsquo;s disc in waters seen:</p>
<p class="line">Knowing how true this is, a man</p>
<p class="line">Should ever practise what is good <span class=
"rm">(<i>Hit.</i> iv. 133).</span></p>
</div>
<p class="first">It is often said that when a man dies and leaves all
his loved ones behind, his good works alone can accompany him on his
journey to his next life. Nor should sin ever be committed in this life
when there is none to see, for it is always witnessed by the &ldquo;old
hermit dwelling in the heart,&rdquo; as the conscience is picturesquely
called.</p>
<p>That spirit of universal tolerance and love of mankind which enabled
Buddhism to overstep the bounds not only of caste but of nationality,
and thus to become the earliest world-religion, breathes throughout
this poetry. Even the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>, though a work of
the Brahmans, contains such liberal sentiments as this:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb381" href="#pb381" name=

<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">

</div>
<p class="first">The following stanza shows how cosmopolitan
Bhart&#7771;ihari was in his views:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">&ldquo;This man&rsquo;s our own, a stranger

<p class="line">Thus narrow-minded people think.</p>
<p class="line">However, noble-minded men</p>
<p class="line">Regard the whole world as their kin.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But these poets go even beyond the limits of humanity
and inculcate sympathy with the joys and sorrows of all
creatures:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">To harm no living thing in deed,</p>
<p class="line">In thought or word, to exercise</p>

</div>
<p class="first">Gentleness and forbearance towards good and bad alike
are thus recommended in the <i>Hitopade&ccedil;a</i>:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">Even to beings destitute</p>
<p class="line">Of virtue good men pity show:</p>
<p class="line">The moon does not her light withdraw</p>
<p class="line">Even from the pariah&rsquo;s abode <span class="rm">(i.
63).</span></p>
</div>
<p class="first">The <i>Panchatantra</i>, again, dissuades thus from
thoughts of revenge:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">Devise no ill at any time</p>
<p class="line">To injure those that do thee harm:</p>
<p class="line">They of themselves will some day fall,</p>
<p class="line">Like trees that grow on river banks.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The good qualities of the virtuous are often described
and contrasted with the characteristics of evil-doers. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb382" href="#pb382" name=
"pb382">382</a>]</span>This, for instance, is how Bhart&#7771;ihari
illustrates the humility of the benevolent:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">The trees bend downward with the burden of their
fruit,</p>
<p class="line">The clouds bow low, heavy with waters they will
shed:</p>
<p class="line">The noble hold not high their heads through pride of
wealth;</p>
<p class="line">Thus those behave who are on others&rsquo; good intent
<span class="rm">(i. 71).</span></p>
</div>
<p class="first">Many fine thoughts about true friendship and the value
of intercourse with good men are found here, often exemplified in a
truly poetical spirit. This, for instance, is from the
<i>Panchatantra</i>:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">Who is not made a better man</p>
<p class="line">By contact with a noble friend?</p>
<p class="line">A water-drop on lotus-leaves</p>
<p class="line">Assumes the splendour of a pearl <span class="rm">(iii.
61).</span></p>
</div>
<p class="first">It is perhaps natural that poetry with a strong
pessimistic colouring should contain many bitter sayings about women
and their character. Here is an example of how they are often
described:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">The love of women but a moment lasts.</p>
<p class="line">Like colours of the dawn or evening red;</p>
<p class="line">Their aims are crooked like a river&rsquo;s course;</p>
<p class="line">Inconstant are they as the lightning flash;</p>
<p class="line">Like serpents, they deserve no confidence <span class=
"rm">(<i>Kath&#257;s.</i> xxxvii. 143).</span></p>
</div>
<p class="first">At the same time there are several passages in which
female character is represented in a more favourable light, and others
sing the praise of faithful wives.</p>
<p>Here, too, we meet with many pithy sayings about the misery of
poverty and the degradation of servitude; while the power of money to
invest the worthless man with the appearance of every talent and virtue
is described with bitter irony and scathing sarcasm.</p>
<p>As might be expected, true knowledge receives frequent <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb383" href="#pb383" name="pb383">383</a>]</span>and
high appreciation in Sanskrit ethical poetry. It is compared with a
rich treasure which cannot be divided among relations, which no thief
can steal, and which is never diminished by being imparted to others.
Contempt, on the other hand, is poured on pedantry and spurious
learning. Those who have read many books, without understanding their
sense, are likened to an ass laden with sandal wood, who feels only the
weight, but knows nothing of the value of his burden.</p>
<p>As the belief in transmigration has cast its shadow over Indian
thought from pre-Buddhistic times, it is only natural that the
conception of fate should be prominent in Sanskrit moral poetry. Here,
indeed, we often read that no one can escape from the operation of
destiny, but at the same time we find constant admonitions not to let
this fact paralyse human effort. For, as is shown in the
<i>Hitopade&ccedil;a</i> and elsewhere, fate is nothing else than the
result of action done in a former birth. Hence every man can by right
conduct shape his future fate, just as a potter can mould a lump of
clay into whatever form he desires. Human action is thus a necessary
complement to fate; the latter cannot proceed without the former any
more than a cart, as the <i>Hitopade&ccedil;a</i> expresses it, can
move with only one wheel. This doctrine is inculcated with many apt
illustrations. Thus in one stanza of the <i>Hitopade&ccedil;a</i> it is
pointed out that &ldquo;antelopes do not enter into the mouth of the
sleeping lion&rdquo;; in another the question is asked, &ldquo;Who
without work could obtain oil from sesamum seeds?&rdquo; Or, as the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> once puts it, fate without human action
cannot be fulfilled, just as seed sown outside the field bears no
fruit.</p>
<p>For those who are suffering from the assaults of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb384" href="#pb384" name=
"pb384">384</a>]</span>adverse fate there are many exhortations to
firmness and constancy. The following is a stanza of this kind from the
<i>Panchatantra</i>:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1662">
<p class="line">In fortune and calamity</p>
<p class="line">The great ever remain the same:</p>
<p class="line">The sun is at its rising red,</p>
<p class="line">Red also when about to set.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Collected in the ethico-didactic works which have been
described in this chapter, and scattered throughout the rest of the
literature, the notions held by the Brahmans in the sphere of moral
philosophy have never received a methodical treatment, as in the
P&#257;li literature of Buddhism. In the orthodox systems of Hindu
philosophy, to which we now turn, they find no place. <span class=

<h2 class="label">Chapter XV</h2>
<h2 class="main">Philosophy</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The beginnings of Indian philosophy, which are to be
found in the latest hymns of the <i>Rigveda</i> and in the
<i>Atharvaveda</i>, are concerned with speculations on the origin of
the world and on the eternal principle by which it is created and
maintained. The <i>Yajurveda</i> further contains fantastic cosmogonic
legends describing how the Creator produces all things by means of the
omnipotent sacrifice. With these Vedic ideas are intimately connected,
and indeed largely identical, those of the earlier Upanishads. This
philosophy is essentially pantheistic and idealistic. By the side of it
grew up an atheistic and empirical school of thought, which in the
sixth century B.C. furnished the foundation of the two great unorthodox
religious systems of Buddhism and Jainism.</p>
<p>The Upanishad philosophy is in a chaotic condition, but the
speculations of this and of other schools of thought were gradually
reduced to order and systematised in manuals from about the first
century of our era onwards. Altogether nine systems may be
distinguished, some of which must in their origin go back to the
beginning of the sixth century B.C. at least. Of the six systems which
are accounted orthodox no less than four were originally atheistic, and
one remained so throughout. The strangeness of this fact disappears
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb386" href="#pb386" name=
"pb386">386</a>]</span>when we reflect that the only conditions of
orthodoxy in India were the recognition of the class privileges of the
Brahman caste and a nominal acknowledgment of the infallibility of the
Veda, neither full agreement with Vedic doctrines nor the confession of
a belief in the existence of God being required. With these two
limitations the utmost freedom of thought prevailed in Brahmanism.
Hence the boldest philosophical speculation and conformity with the
popular religion went hand and hand, to a degree which has never been
equalled in any other country. Of the orthodox systems, by far the most
important are the pantheistic Ved&#257;nta, which, as continuing the
doctrines of the Upanishads, has been the dominant philosophy of
Brahmanism since the end of the Vedic period, and the atheistic
S&#257;nkhya, which, for the first time in the history of the world,
asserted the complete independence of the human mind and attempted to
solve its problems solely by the aid of reason.</p>
<p>On the S&#257;nkhya were based the two heterodox religious systems
of Buddhism and Jainism, which denied the authority of the Veda, and
opposed the Brahman caste system and ceremonial. Still more heterodox
was the Materialist philosophy of Ch&#257;rv&#257;ka, which went
further and denied even the fundamental doctrines common to all other
schools of Indian thought, orthodox and unorthodox, the belief in
transmigration dependent on retribution, and the belief in salvation or
release from transmigration.</p>
<p>The theory that every individual passes after death into a series of
new existences in heavens or hells, or in the bodies of men and
animals, or in plants on earth, where it is rewarded or punished for
all deeds committed in a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb387" href=
"#pb387" name="pb387">387</a>]</span>former life, was already so firmly
established in the sixth century B.C., that Buddha received it without
question into his religious system; and it has dominated the belief of
the Indian people from those early times down to the present day. There
is, perhaps, no more remarkable fact in the history of the human mind
than that this strange doctrine, never philosophically demonstrated,
should have been regarded as self-evident for 2500 years by every
philosophical school or religious sect in India, excepting only the
Materialists. By the acceptance of this doctrine the Vedic optimism,
which looked forward to a life of eternal happiness in heaven, was
transformed into the gloomy prospect of an interminable series of
miserable existences leading from one death to another. The transition
to the developed view of the Upanishads is to be found in the
<i>&Ccedil;atapatha Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i> (above, p. 223).</p>
<p>How is the origin of the momentous doctrine which produced this
change to be accounted for? The <i>Rigveda</i> contains no traces of it
beyond a couple of passages in the last book which speak of the soul of
a dead man as going to the waters or plants. It seems hardly likely
that so far-reaching a theory should have been developed from the stray
fancies of one or two later Vedic poets. It seems more probable that
the Aryan settlers received the first impulse in this direction from
the aboriginal inhabitants of India. As is well known, there is among
half-savage tribes a wide-spread belief that the soul after death
passes into the trunks of trees and the bodies of animals. Thus the
Sonthals of India are said even at the present day to hold that the
souls of the good enter into fruit-bearing trees. But among such races
the notion of transmigration does not go beyond a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb388" href="#pb388" name=
"pb388">388</a>]</span>belief in the continuance of human existence in
animals and trees. If, therefore, the Aryan Indians borrowed the idea
from the aborigines, they certainly deserve the credit of having
elaborated out of it the theory of an unbroken chain of existences,
intimately connected with the moral principle of requ&iuml;tal. The
immovable hold it acquired on Indian thought is doubtless due to the
satisfactory explanation it offered of the misfortune or prosperity
which is often clearly caused by no action done in this life. Indeed,
the Indian doctrine of transmigration, fantastic though it may appear
to us, has the twofold merit of satisfying the requirement of justice
in the moral government of the world, and at the same time inculcating
a valuable ethical principle which makes every man the architect of his
own fate. For, as every bad deed done in this existence must be
expiated, so every good deed will be rewarded in the next existence.
From the enjoyment of the fruits of actions already done there is no
escape; for, in the words of the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>,
&ldquo;as among a thousand cows a calf finds its mother, so the deed
previously done follows after the doer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cycle of existences (<i>sam&#803;s&#257;ra</i>) is regarded as
having no beginning, for as every event of the present life is the
result of an action done in a past one, the same must hold true of each
preceding existence <i>ad infinitum</i>. The subsequent effectiveness
of guilt and of merit, commonly called <i>ad&#7771;ish&#7789;a</i> or
&ldquo;the unseen,&rdquo; but often also simply <i>karma</i>,
&ldquo;deed or work,&rdquo; is believed to regulate not only the life
of the individual, but the origin and development of everything in the
world; for whatever takes place cannot but affect some creature, and
must therefore, by the law of retribution, be due to some previous act
of that creature. In other words, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb389"
href="#pb389" name="pb389">389</a>]</span>the operations of nature are
also the results of the good or bad deeds of living beings. There is
thus no room for independent divine rule by the side of the power of
<i>karma</i>, which governs everything with iron necessity. Hence, even
the systems which acknowledge a God can only assign to him the function
of guiding the world and the life of creatures in strict accordance
with the law of retribution, which even he cannot break. The periodic
destruction and renewal of the universe, an application of the theory
on a grand scale, forms part of the doctrine of
<i>sam&#803;s&#257;ra</i> or cycle of existence.</p>
<p>Common to all the systems of philosophy, and as old as that of
transmigration, is the doctrine of salvation, which puts an end to
transmigration. All action is brought about by desire, which, in its
turn is based on <i>avidy&#257;</i>, a sort of &ldquo;ignorance,&rdquo;
that mistakes the true nature of things, and is the ultimate source of
transmigration. Originally having only the negative sense of
non-knowledge (<i>a-vidy&#257;</i>), the word here came to have the
positive sense of &ldquo;false knowledge.&rdquo; Such ignorance is
dispelled by saving knowledge, which, according to every philosophical
school of India, consists in some special form of cognition. This
universal knowledge, which is not the result of merit, but breaks into
life independently, destroys, the subsequent effect of works which
would otherwise bear fruit in future existences, and thus puts an end
to transmigration. It cannot, however, influence those works the fruit
of which has already begun to ripen. Hence, the present life continues
from the moment of enlightenment till definite salvation at death, just
as the potter&rsquo;s wheel goes on revolving for a time after the
completion of the pot. But no merit or demerit results from acts done
after enlightenment (or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb390" href=
"#pb390" name="pb390">390</a>]</span>&ldquo;conversion&rdquo; as we
should say), because all desire for the objects of the world is at an
end.</p>
<p>The popular beliefs about heavens and hells, gods, demi-gods, and
demons, were retained in Buddhism and Jainism, as well as in the
orthodox systems. But these higher and more fortunate beings were
considered to be also subject to the law of transmigration, and, unless
they obtained saving knowledge, to be on a lower level than the man who
had obtained such knowledge.</p>
<p>The monistic theory of the early Upanishads, which identified the
individual soul with Brahma, aroused the opposition of the
rationalistic founder of the S&#257;nkhya system, <span class=
"sc">Kapila</span>, who, according to Buddhist legends, was
pre-Buddhistic, and whose doctrines Buddha followed and elaborated. His
teaching is entirely dualistic, admitting only two things, both without
beginning and end, but essentially different, matter on the one hand,
and an infinite plurality of individual souls on the other. An account
of the nature and the mutual relation of these two, forms the main
content of the system. Kapila was, indeed, the first who drew a sharp
line of demarcation between the two domains of matter and soul. The
saving knowledge which delivers from the misery of transmigration
consists, according to the S&#257;nkhya system, in recognising the
absolute distinction between soul and matter.</p>
<p>The existence of a supreme god who creates and rules the universe is
denied, and would be irreconcilable with the system. For according to
its doctrine the unconscious matter of Nature originally contains
within itself the power of evolution (in the interest of souls, which
are entirely passive during the process), while <i>karma</i> alone
determines the course of that evolution. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb391" href="#pb391" name="pb391">391</a>]</span>The adherents of the
system defend their atheism by maintaining that the origin of misery
presents an insoluble problem to the theist, for a god who has created
and rules the world could not possibly escape from the reproach of
cruelty and partiality. Much stress is laid by this school in general
on the absence of any cogent proof for the existence of God.</p>
<p>The world is maintained to be real, and that from all eternity; for
the existent can only be produced from the existent. The reality of an
object is regarded as resulting simply from perception, always
supposing the senses of the perceiver to be sound. The world is
described as developing according to certain laws out of primitive
matter (<i>prak&#7771;iti</i> or <i>pradh&#257;na</i>). The genuine
philosophic spirit of its method of rising from the known elements of
experience to the unknown by logical demonstration till the ultimate
cause is reached, must give this system a special interest in the eyes
of evolutionists whose views are founded on the results of modern
physical science.</p>
<p>The evolution and diversity of the world are explained by
prim&aelig;val matter, although uniform and indivisible, consisting of
three different substances called <i>gu&#7751;as</i> or constituents
(originally &ldquo;strands&rdquo; of a rope). By the combination of
these in varying proportions the diverse material products were
supposed to have arisen. The constituent, called <i>sattva</i>,
distinguished by the qualities of luminousness and lightness in the
object, and by virtue, benevolence, and other pleasing attributes in
the subject, is associated with the feeling of joy; <i>rajas</i>,
distinguished by activity and various hurtful qualities, is associated
with pain; and <i>tamas</i>, distinguished by heaviness, rigidity, and
darkness on the one hand, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb392"
href="#pb392" name="pb392">392</a>]</span>fear, unconsciousness, and so
forth, on the other, is associated with apathy. At the end of a cosmic
period all things are supposed to be dissolved into primitive matter,
the alternations of evolution, existence, and dissolution having
neither beginning nor end.</p>
<p>The psychology of the S&#257;nkhya system is specially important.
Peculiarly interesting is its doctrine that all mental operations, such
as perception, thinking, willing, are not performed by the soul, but
are merely mechanical processes of the internal organs, that is to say,
of matter. The soul itself possesses no attributes or qualities, and
can only be described negatively. There being no qualitative difference
between souls, the principle of personality and identity is supplied by
the subtile or internal body, which, chiefly formed of the inner organs
and the senses, surrounds and is made conscious by the soul. This
internal body, being the vehicle of merit and demerit, which are the
basis of transmigration, accompanies the soul on its wanderings from
one gross body to another, whether the latter be that of a god, a man,
an animal, or a tree. Conscious life is bondage to pain, in which
pleasure is included by this peculiarly pessimistic system. When
salvation, which is the absolute cessation of pain, is obtained, the
internal body is dissolved into its material elements, and the soul,
becoming finally isolated, continues to exist individually, but in
absolute unconsciousness.</p>
<p>The name of the system, which only begins to be mentioned in the
later Upanishads, and more frequently in the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>, is derived from
<i>sam&#803;khy&#257;</i>, &ldquo;number.&rdquo; There is, however,
some doubt as to whether it originally meant &ldquo;enumeration,&rdquo;
from the twenty-five <i>tattvas</i> or principles which it sets forth,
or &ldquo;inferential or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb393" href=
"#pb393" name="pb393">393</a>]</span>discriminative&rdquo; doctrine,
from the method which it pursues.</p>
<p>Kapila, the founder of the system, whose teaching is presupposed by
Buddhism, and whom Buddhistic legend connects with Kapila-vastu, the
birthplace of Buddha, must have lived before the middle of the sixth
century. No work of his, if he ever committed his system to writing,
has been preserved. Indeed, the very existence of such a person as
Kapila has been doubted, in spite of the unanimity with which Indian
tradition designates a man of this name as the founder of the system.
The second leading authority of the S&#257;nkhya philosophy was
Pancha&ccedil;ikha, who may have lived about the beginning of our era.
The oldest systematic manual which has been preserved is the
<i>S&#257;nkhya-k&#257;rik&#257;</i> of <span class=
"sc">&#298;&ccedil;vara-k&#7771;ish&#7751;a</span>. As it was
translated into Chinese between 557 and 583 A.D., it cannot belong to a
later century than the fifth, and may be still older. This work deals
very concisely and methodically with the doctrines of the S&#257;nkhya
in sixty-nine stanzas (composed in the complicated
<i>&#256;ry&#257;</i> metre), to which three others were subsequently
added. It appears to have superseded the S&#363;tras of
Pancha&ccedil;ikha, who is mentioned in it as the chief disseminator of
the system. There are two excellent commentaries on the
<i>S&#257;nkhya-k&#257;rik&#257;</i>, the one composed about 700 A.D.
by Gau&#7693;ap&#257;da, and the other soon after 1100 A.D. by
V&#257;chaspati Mi&ccedil;ra.</p>
<p>The <i>S&#257;nkhya S&#363;tras</i>, long regarded as the oldest
manual of the system, and attributed to Kapila, were probably not
composed till about 1400 A.D. The author of this work, which also goes
by the name of <i>S&#257;nkhya-pravachana</i>, endeavours in vain to
show that there is no difference between the doctrines of the
S&#257;nkhya and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb394" href="#pb394"
name="pb394">394</a>]</span>of the Upanishads. He is also much
influenced by the ideas of the Yoga as well as the Ved&#257;nta system.
In the oldest commentary on this work, that of Aniruddha, composed
about 1500 A.D., the objectiveness of the treatment is particularly
useful. Much more detailed, but far less objective, is the commentary
of Vijn&#257;na-bhikshu, entitled
<i>S&#257;nkhya-pravachana-bh&#257;shya</i>, and written in the second
half of the sixteenth century. The author&rsquo;s point of view being
theistic, he effaces the characteristic features of the different
systems in the endeavour to show that all the six orthodox systems
contain the absolute truth in their main doctrines.</p>
<p>From the beginning of our era down to recent times the S&#257;nkhya
doctrines have exercised considerable influence on the religious and
philosophical life of India, though to a much less extent than the
Ved&#257;nta. Some of its individual teachings, such as that of the
three <i>gu&#7751;as</i>, have become the common property of the whole
of Sanskrit literature. At the time of the great Ved&#257;ntist,
&Ccedil;ankara (800 A.D.), the S&#257;nkhya system was held in high
honour. The law book of Manu followed this doctrine, though with an
admixture of the theistic notions of the M&#299;m&#257;m&#803;s&#257;
and Ved&#257;nta systems as well as of popular mythology. The
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>, especially Book XII., is full of
S&#257;nkhya doctrines; indeed almost every detail of the teachings of
this system is to be found somewhere in the great epic. Its numerous
deviations from the regular S&#257;nkhya text-books are only secondary,
as Professor Garbe thinks, even though the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>
is our oldest actual source for the system. Nearly half the
Pur&#257;&#7751;as follow the cosmogony of the S&#257;nkhya, and even
those which are Ved&#257;ntic are largely influenced by its doctrines.
The purity of the S&#257;nkhya <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb395"
href="#pb395" name="pb395">395</a>]</span>notions are, however,
everywhere in the Pur&#257;&#7751;as obscured by Ved&#257;nta
doctrines, especially that of cosmical illusion. A peculiarity of the
Pur&#257;&#7751;ic S&#257;nkhya is the conception of Spirit or
<i>Purusha</i> as the male, and Matter or <i>Prak&#7771;iti</i> as the
female, principle in creation.</p>
<p>On the S&#257;nkhya system are based the two philosophical religions
of Buddhism and Jainism in all their main outlines. Their fundamental
doctrine is that life is nothing but suffering. The cause of suffering
is the desire, based on ignorance, to live and enjoy the world. The aim
of both is to redeem mankind from the misery of mundane existence by
the annihilation of desire, with the aid of renunciation of the world
and the practice of unbounded kindness towards all creatures. These two
pessimistic religions are so extremely similar that the Jainas, or
adherents of Jina, were long looked upon as a Buddhist sect. Research
has, however, led to the discovery that the founders of both systems
were contemporaries, the most eminent of the many teachers who in the
sixth century opposed the Brahman ceremonial and caste pretensions in
Northern Central India. Both religions, while acknowledging the lower
and ephemeral gods of Brahmanism, deny, like the S&#257;nkhya, the
existence of an eternal supreme Deity. As they developed, they diverged
in various respects from the system to which they owed their
philosophical notions. Hence it came about that S&#257;nkhya writers
stoutly opposed some of their teachings, particularly the Buddhist
denial of soul, the doctrine that all things have only a momentary
existence, and that salvation is an annihilation of self. Here,
however, it should be noted that Buddha himself refused to decide the
question whether <i>nirv&#257;&#7751;a</i> is complete extinction or an
unending state of unconscious bliss. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb396" href="#pb396" name="pb396">396</a>]</span>The latter view was
doubtless a concession to the Ved&#257;ntic conception of Brahma, in
which the individual soul is merged on attaining salvation.</p>
<p>The importance of these systems lies not in their metaphysical
speculations, which occupy but a subordinate position, but in their
high development of moral principles, which are almost entirely
neglected in the orthodox systems of Indian philosophy. The fate of the
two religions has been strangely different. Jainism has survived as an
insignificant sect in India alone; Buddhism has long since vanished
from the land of its birth, but has become a world religion counting
more adherents than any other faith.</p>
<p>The S&#257;nkhya philosophy, with the addition of a peculiar form of
mental asceticism as the most effective means of acquiring saving
knowledge, appears to have assumed definite shape in a manual at an
earlier period than any of the other orthodox systems. This is the Yoga
philosophy founded by <span class="sc">Patanjali</span> and expounded
in the <i>Yoga S&#363;tras</i>. The priority of this text-book is
rendered highly probable by the fact that it is the only philosophical
S&#363;tra work which contains no polemics against the others. There
seems, moreover, to be no sufficient ground to doubt the correctness of
the native tradition identifying the founder of the Yoga system with
the grammarian Patanjali. The <i>Yoga S&#363;tras</i> therefore
probably date from the second century B.C. This work also goes by the
name of <i>S&#257;nkhya-pravachana</i>, the same as that given to the
later <i>S&#257;nkhya S&#363;tras</i>, a sufficiently clear proof of
its close connection with Kapila&rsquo;s philosophy. In the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> the two systems are actually spoken of as
one and the same.</p>
<p>In order to make his system more acceptable, Patanjali <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb397" href="#pb397" name=
"pb397">397</a>]</span>introduced into it the doctrine of a personal
god, but in so loose a way as not to affect the system as a whole.
Indeed, the parts of the S&#363;tras dealing with the person of God are
not only unconnected with the other parts of the treatise, but even
contradict the foundations of the system. For the final aim of man is
here represented as the absolute isolation (<i>kaivalya</i>) of the
soul from matter, just as in the S&#257;nkhya system, and not union
with or absorption in God. Nor are the individual souls here derived
from the &ldquo;special soul&rdquo; or God, but are like the latter
without a beginning.</p>
<p>The really distinctive part of the system is the establishment of
the views prevailing in Patanjali&rsquo;s time with regard to
asceticism and the mysterious powers to be acquired by its practice.
<i>Yoga</i>, or &ldquo;yoking&rdquo; the mind, means mental
concentration on a particular object. The belief that fasting and other
penances produce supernatural powers goes back to remote prehistoric
times, and still prevails among savage races. Bodily asceticism of this
kind is known to the Vedas under the name of <i>tapas</i>. From this,
with the advance of intellectual life in India, was developed the
practice of mental asceticism called <i>yoga</i>, which must have been
known and practised several centuries before Patanjali&rsquo;s time.
For recent investigations have shown that Buddhism started not only
from the theoretical S&#257;nkhya but from the practical Yoga doctrine;
and the condition of ecstatic abstraction was from the beginning held
in high esteem among the Buddhists. Patanjali only elaborated the
doctrine, describing at length the means of attaining concentration and
carrying it to the highest pitch. In his system the methodical practice
of Yoga acquired a special importance; for, in addition to conferring
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb398" href="#pb398" name=
"pb398">398</a>]</span>supernatural powers, it here becomes the chief
means of salvation. His S&#363;tras consist of four chapters dealing
with deep meditation (<i>sam&#257;dhi</i>), the means for obtaining it
(<i>s&#257;dhana</i>), the miraculous powers (<i>vibh&#363;ti</i>) it
confers, and the isolation (<i>kaivalya</i>) of the redeemed soul. The
oldest and best commentary on this work is that of Vy&#257;sa, dating
from the seventh century A.D.</p>
<p>Many of the later Upanishads are largely concerned with the Yoga
doctrine. The lawbook of Manu in Book VI. refers to various details of
Yoga practice. Indeed, it seems likely, owing to the theistic point of
view of that work, that its S&#257;nkhya notions were derived from the
Yoga system. The <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> treats of Yoga in
considerable detail, especially in Book XII. It is particularly
prominent in the <i>Bhagavadg&#299;t&#257;</i>, which is even
designated a <i>yoga-&ccedil;&#257;stra</i>. Belief in the efficacy of
Yoga still prevails in India, and its practice survives. But its
adherents, the Yog&#299;s, are at the present day often nothing more
than conjurers and jugglers.</p>
<p>The exercises of mental concentration are in the later commentaries
distinguished by the name of <i>r&#257;ja-yoga</i> or &ldquo;chief
Yoga.&rdquo; The external expedients are called <i>kriy&#257;-yoga</i>,
or &ldquo;practical Yoga.&rdquo; The more intense form of the latter,
in later works called <i>ha&#7789;ha-yoga</i>, or &ldquo;forcible
Yoga,&rdquo; and dealing for the most part with suppression of the
breath, is very often contrasted with <i>r&#257;ja-yoga</i>.</p>
<p>Among the eight branches of Yoga practice the sitting posture
(<i>&#257;sana</i>), as not only conducive to concentration, but of
therapeutic value, is considered important. In describing its various
forms later writers positively revelled, eighty-four being frequently
stated to be their normal number. In the <i>ha&#7789;ha-yoga</i> there
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb399" href="#pb399" name=
"pb399">399</a>]</span>are also a number of other postures and
contortions of the limbs designated <i>mudr&#257;</i>. The best-known
<i>mudr&#257;</i>, called <i>khechar&#299;</i>, consists in turning the
tongue back towards the throat and keeping the gaze fixed on a point
between the eyebrows. Such practices, in conjunction with the
suppression of breath, were capable of producing a condition of trance.
There is at least the one well-authenticated case of a Yog&#299; named
Harid&#257;s who in the thirties wandered about in R&#257;jput&#257;na
and Lahore, allowing himself to be buried for money when in the
cataleptic condition. The burial of the Master of Ballantrae by the
Indian Secundra Dass in Stevenson&rsquo;s novel was doubtless suggested
by an account of this ascetic.</p>
<p>In contrast with the two older and intimately connected dualistic
schools of the S&#257;nkhya and Yoga, there arose about the beginning
of our era the only two, even of the six orthodox systems of
philosophy, which were theistic from the outset. One of them, being
based on the Vedas and the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as, is concerned with the
practical side of Vedic religion; while the other, alone among the
philosophical systems, represents a methodical development of the
fundamental non-dualistic speculations of the Upanishads. The former,
which has only been accounted a philosophical system at all because of
its close connection with the latter, is the
<i>P&#363;rva-m&#299;m&#257;m&#803;s&#257;</i> or &ldquo;First
Inquiry,&rdquo; also called <i>Karma-m&#299;m&#257;m&#803;s&#257;</i>
or &ldquo;Inquiry concerning Works,&rdquo; but usually simply
<i>M&#299;m&#257;m&#803;s&#257;</i>. Founded by <span class=
"sc">Jaimini</span>, and set forth in the
<i>Karma-m&#299;m&#257;m&#803;s&#257; S&#363;tras</i>, this system
discusses the sacred ceremonies and the rewards resulting from their
performance. Holding the Veda to be uncreated and existent from all
eternity, it lays special stress on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb400" href="#pb400" name="pb400">400</a>]</span>proposition that
articulate sounds are eternal, and on the consequent doctrine that the
connection of a word with its sense is not due to convention, but is by
nature inherent in the word itself. Owing to its lack of philosophical
interest, this system has not as yet much occupied the attention of
European scholars.</p>
<p>The oldest commentary in existence on the
<i>M&#299;m&#257;m&#803;s&#257; S&#363;tras</i> is the
<i>bh&#257;shya</i> of &Ccedil;abara Sv&#257;min, which in its turn was
commented on about 700 A.D. by the great M&#299;m&#257;m&#803;sist
<span class="sc">Kum&#257;rila</span> in his
<i>Tantra-v&#257;rttika</i> and in his
<i>&Ccedil;loka-v&#257;rttika</i>, the latter a metrical paraphrase of
&Ccedil;abara&rsquo;s exposition of the first aphorism of Patanjali.
Among the later commentaries on the <i>M&#299;m&#257;m&#803;s&#257;
S&#363;tras</i> the most important is the
<i>Jaimin&#299;ya-ny&#257;ya-m&#257;l&#257;-vistara</i> of M&#257;dhava
(fourteenth century).</p>
<p>Far more deserving of attention is the theoretical system of the
<i>Uttara-M&#299;m&#257;m&#803;s&#257;</i>, or &ldquo;Second
Inquiry.&rdquo; For it not only systematises the doctrines of the
Upanishads&mdash;therefore usually termed <i>Ved&#257;nta</i>, or
&ldquo;End of the Veda&rdquo;&mdash;but also represents the
philosophical views of the Indian thinkers of to-day. In the words of
Professor Deussen, its relation to the earlier Upanishads resembles
that of Christian dogmatics to the New Testament. Its fundamental
doctrine, expressed in the famous formula <i>tat tvam asi</i>,
&ldquo;thou art that,&rdquo; is the identity of the individual soul
with God (<i>brahma</i>). Hence it is also called the <i>Brahma-</i> or
<i>&Ccedil;&#257;r&#299;raka-m&#299;m&#257;m&#803;s&#257;</i>,
&ldquo;Inquiry concerning Brahma or the embodied soul.&rdquo; The
eternal and infinite Brahma not being made up of parts or liable to
change, the individual soul, it is here laid down, cannot be a part or
emanation of it, but is the whole indivisible Brahma. As there is no
other existence but Brahma, the Ved&#257;nta is styled <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb401" href="#pb401" name="pb401">401</a>]</span>the
<i>advaita-v&#257;da</i>, or &ldquo;doctrine of non-duality,&rdquo;
being, in other words, an idealistic monism. The evidence of
experience, which shows a multiplicity of phenomena, and the statements
of the Veda, which teach a multiplicity of souls, are brushed aside as
the phantasms of a dream which are only true till waking takes
place.</p>
<p>The ultimate cause of all such false impressions is
<i>avidy&#257;</i> or innate ignorance, which this, like the other
systems, simply postulates, but does not in any way seek to account
for. It is this ignorance which prevents the soul from recognising that
the empirical world is mere <i>m&#257;y&#257;</i> or illusion. Thus to
the Ved&#257;ntist the universe is like a mirage, which the soul under
the influence of desire (<i>t&#7771;ish&#7751;&#257;</i> or
&ldquo;thirst&rdquo;) fancies it perceives, just as the panting hart
sees before it sheets of water in the <i>fata morgana</i>
(picturesquely called <i>m&#7771;iga-t&#7771;ish&#7751;&#257;</i> or
&ldquo;deer-thirst&rdquo; in Sanskrit). The illusion vanishes as if by
magic, when the scales fall from the eyes, on the acquisition of true
knowledge. Then the semblance of any distinction between the soul and
God disappears, and salvation (<i>moksha</i>), the chief end of man, is
attained.</p>
<p>Saving knowledge cannot of course be acquired by worldly experience,
but is revealed in the theoretical part
(<i>jn&#257;na-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</i>) of the Vedas, that is to
say, in the Upanishads. By this correct knowledge the illusion of the
multiplicity of phenomena is dispelled, just as the illusion of a snake
when there is only a rope. Two forms of knowledge are, however,
distinguished in the Ved&#257;nta, a higher (<i>par&#257;</i>) and a
lower (<i>apar&#257;</i>). The former is concerned with the higher and
impersonal Brahma (neuter), which is without form or attributes, while
the latter deals with the lower and personal Brahm&#257; (masculine),
who is the soul of the universe, the Lord <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb402" href="#pb402" name=
"pb402">402</a>]</span>(<i>&#299;&ccedil;vara</i>) who has created the
world and grants salvation. The contradiction resulting from one and
the same thing having form and no form, attributes and no attributes,
is solved by the explanation that the lower Brahm&#257; has no reality,
but is merely an illusory form of the higher and only Brahma, produced
by ignorance.</p>
<p>The doctrines of the Ved&#257;nta are laid down in the
<i>Brahma-s&#363;tras</i> of B&#257;dar&#257;ya&#7751;a. This
text-book, the meaning of which is not intelligible without the aid of
a commentary, was expounded in his <i>bh&#257;shya</i> by the famous
Ved&#257;ntist philosopher <span class="sc">&Ccedil;ankara</span>,
whose name is intimately connected with the revival of Brahmanism. He
was born in 788 A.D., became an ascetic in 820, and probably lived to
an advanced age. There is every likelihood that his expositions agree
in all essentials with the meaning of the <i>Brahma-s&#363;tras</i>,
The full elaboration of the doctrine of <i>M&#257;y&#257;</i>, or
cosmic illusion, is, however, due to him. An excellent epitome of the
teachings of the Ved&#257;nta, as set forth by &Ccedil;ankara, is the
<i>Ved&#257;nta-s&#257;ra</i> of Sad&#257;nanda Yog&#299;ndra. Its
author departs from &Ccedil;ankara&rsquo;s views only in a few
particulars, which show an admixture of S&#257;nkhya doctrine.</p>
<p>Among the many commentaries on the <i>Brahma-s&#363;tras</i>
subsequent to &Ccedil;ankara, the most important is that of
R&#257;m&#257;nuja, who lived in the earlier half of the twelfth
century. This writer gives expression to the views of the
P&#257;nchar&#257;tras or Bh&#257;gavatas, an old Vishnuite sect, whose
doctrine, closely allied to Christian ideas, is expounded in the
<i>Bhagavadg&#299;t&#257;</i> and the
<i>Bh&#257;gavata-pur&#257;&#7751;a</i>, as well as in the special
text-books of the sect. The tenets of the Bh&#257;gavatas, as set forth
by R&#257;m&#257;nuja, diverge considerably from those of the
<i>Brahma-s&#363;tras</i> on which he is commenting. For, according
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb403" href="#pb403" name=
"pb403">403</a>]</span>to him, individual souls are not identical with
God; they suffer from innate unbelief, not ignorance, while belief or
the love of God (<i>bhakti</i>), not knowledge, is the means of
salvation or union with God.</p>
<p>The last two orthodox systems of philosophy, the Vai&ccedil;eshika
and the Ny&#257;ya, form a closely-connected pair, since a strict
classification of ideas, as well as the explanation of the origin of
the world from atoms, is common to both. Much the older of the two is
the Vai&ccedil;eshika, which is already assailed in the
<i>Brahma-s&#363;tras</i>. It is there described as undeserving of
attention, because it had no adherents. This was certainly not the case
in later times, when this system became very popular. It received its
name from the category of &ldquo;particularity&rdquo;
(<i>vi&ccedil;esha</i>) on which great stress is laid in its theory of
atoms. The memory of its founder is only preserved in his nickname
Ka&#7751;&#257;da (also Ka&#7751;abhuj or Ka&#7751;a-bhaksha), which
means &ldquo;atom-eater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The main importance of the system lies in the logical categories
which it set up and under which it classed all phenomena. The six which
it originally set up are substance, quality, motion, generality,
particularity, and inherence. They are rigorously defined and further
subdivided. The most interesting is that of inherence or inseparable
connection (<i>samav&#257;ya</i>), which, being clearly distinguished
from that of accident or separable connection (<i>sam&#803;yoga</i>),
is described as the relation between a thing and its properties, the
whole and its parts, genus and species, motion and the object in
motion. Later was added a seventh, that of non-existence
(<i>abh&#257;va</i>), which, by affording special facilities for the
display of subtlety, has had a momentous influence on Indian logic.
This category was further subdivided into prior <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb404" href="#pb404" name="pb404">404</a>]</span>and
posterior non-existence (which we should respectively call future and
past existence), mutual non-existence (as between a jar and cloth), and
absolute non-existence (as fire in water).</p>
<p>Though largely concerned with these categories, the
Vai&ccedil;eshika system aimed at attaining a comprehensive philosophic
view in connection with them. Thus while dealing with the category of
&ldquo;substance,&rdquo; it develops its theory of the origin of the
world from atoms. The consideration of the category of
&ldquo;quality&rdquo; similarly leads to its treatment of psychology,
which is remarkable and has analogies with that of the S&#257;nkhya.
Soul is here regarded as without beginning or end, and all-pervading,
subject to the limitations of neither time nor space. Intimately
connected with soul is &ldquo;mind&rdquo; (<i>manas</i>), the internal
organ of thought, which alone enables the soul to know not only
external objects but its own qualities. As this organ is, in contrast
with soul, an atom, it can only comprehend a single object at any given
moment. This is the explanation why the soul cannot be conscious of all
objects simultaneously.</p>
<p>The Ny&#257;ya system is only a development and complement of that
of Ka&#7751;&#257;da, its metaphysics and psychology being the same.
Its specific character consists in its being a very detailed and acute
exposition of formal logic. As such it has remained the foundation of
philosophical studies in India down to the present day. Besides dealing
fully with the means of knowledge, which it states to be perception,
inference, analogy, and trustworthy evidence, it treats exhaustively of
syllogisms and fallacies. It is interesting to note that the Indian
mind here independently arrived at an exposition of the syllogism as
the form of deductive reasoning. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb405" href="#pb405" name="pb405">405</a>]</span>text-book of this
system is the <i>Ny&#257;ya-s&#363;tra</i> of Gotama. The importance
here attached to logic appears from the very first aphorism, which
enumerates sixteen logical notions with the remark that salvation
depends on a correct knowledge of their nature.</p>
<p>Neither the <i>Vai&ccedil;eshika</i> nor the
<i>Ny&#257;ya-s&#363;tras</i> originally accepted the existence of God;
and though both schools later became theistic, they never went so far
as to assume a creator of matter. Their theology is first found
developed in Udayan&#257;ch&#257;rya&rsquo;s <i>Kusum&#257;njali</i>,
which was written about 1200 A.D., and in works which deal with the two
systems conjointly. Here God is regarded as a &ldquo;special&rdquo;
soul, which differs from all other individual eternal souls by
exemption from all qualities connected with transmigration, and by the
possession of the power and knowledge qualifying him to be a regulator
of the universe.</p>
<p>Of the eclectic movement combining S&#257;nkhya, Yoga, and
Ved&#257;nta doctrines, the oldest literary representative is the
<i>&Ccedil;vet&#257;&ccedil;vatara Upanishad</i>. More famous is the
<i>Bhagavadg&#299;t&#257;</i> in which the Supreme Being incarnate as
K&#7771;ish&#7751;a expounds to Arjuna his doctrines in this sense. The
burden of his teaching is that the zealous performance of his duty is a
man&rsquo;s most important task, to whatever caste he may belong. The
beauty and the power of the language in which this doctrine is
inculcated, is unsurpassed in any other work of Indian literature.</p>
<p>By the side of the orthodox systems and the two non-Brahmanical
religions, flourished the <i>lok&#257;yata</i> (&ldquo;directed to the
world of sense&rdquo;), or materialistic school, usually called that of
the Ch&#257;rv&#257;kas from the name of the founder of the doctrine.
It was regarded as peculiarly heretical, for it not only rejected the
authority of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb406" href="#pb406"
name="pb406">406</a>]</span>Vedas and Brahmanic ceremonial, but denied
the doctrines of transmigration and salvation accepted by all other
systems. Materialistic teachings may be traced even before the time of
Buddha, and they have had many secret followers in India down to the
present day. The system, however, seems never to have had more than one
text-book, the lost S&#363;tras of B&#7771;ihaspati, its mythical
founder. Our knowledge of it is derived partly from the polemics of
other schools, but especially from the
<i>Sarvadar&ccedil;ana-sam&#803;graha</i>, or &ldquo;Compendium of all
the Philosophical Systems,&rdquo; composed in the fourteenth century by
the well-known Ved&#257;ntist M&#257;dhav&#257;ch&#257;rya, brother of
S&#257;ya&#7751;a. The strong scepticism of the Ch&#257;rv&#257;kas
showed itself in the rejection of all the means of knowledge accepted
by other schools, excepting perception. To them matter was the only
reality. Soul they regarded as nothing but the body with the attribute
of intelligence. They held it to be created when the body is formed by
the combination of elements, just as the power of intoxication arises
from the mixture of certain ingredients. Hence with the annihilation of
the body the soul also is annihilated. Not transmigration, they affirm,
but the true nature of things, is the cause from which phenomena
proceed. The existence of all that transcends the senses they deny,
sometimes with an admixture of irony. Thus the highest being, they say,
is the king of the land, whose existence is proved by the perception of
the whole world; hell is earthly pain produced by earthly causes; and
salvation is the dissolution of the body. Even in the attribution of
their text-book to B&#7771;ihaspati, the name of the preceptor of the
gods, a touch of irony is to be detected. The religion of the Brahmans
receives a severe handling. The Vedas, say the Ch&#257;rv&#257;kas, are
only the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb407" href="#pb407" name=
"pb407">407</a>]</span>incoherent rhapsodies of knaves, and are tainted
with the three blemishes of falsehood, self-contradiction, and
tautology; Vedic teachers are impostors, whose doctrines are mutually
destructive; and the ritual of the Brahmans is useful only as a means
of livelihood. &ldquo;If,&rdquo; they ask, &ldquo;an animal sacrificed
reaches heaven, why does the sacrificer not rather offer his own
father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the moral side the system is pure hedonism. For the only end of
man is here stated to be sensual pleasure, which is to be enjoyed by
neglecting as far as possible the pains connected with it, just as a
man who desires fish takes the scales and bones into the bargain.
&ldquo;While life remains, let a man live happily, let him feed on ghee
even though he run into debt; when once the body becomes ashes, how can
it ever return again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The author of the <i>Sarvadar&ccedil;ana-sam&#803;graha</i>, placing
himself with remarkable mental detachment in the position of an
adherent in each case, describes altogether sixteen systems. The six
which have not been sketched above, besides being of little importance,
are not purely philosophic. Five of these are sectarian, one Vishnuite
and four &Ccedil;ivite, all of them being strongly tinctured with
S&#257;nkhya and Ved&#257;nta doctrines. The sixth, the system of
P&#257;&#7751;ini, is classed by M&#257;dhava among the philosophies,
simply because the Indian grammarians accepted the
M&#299;m&#257;m&#803;s&#257; dogma of the eternity of sound, and
philosophically developed the Yoga theory of the <i>sphu&#7789;a</i>,
or the imperceptible and eternal element inherent in every word as the
vehicle of its sense. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb408" href=

<h2 class="main">Sanskrit Literature and the West</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Want of space makes it impossible for me to give even
the briefest account of the numerous and, in many cases, important
legal and scientific works written in Sanskrit. But I cannot conclude
this survey of Sanskrit literature as an embodiment of Indian culture
without sketching rapidly the influence which it has received from and
exercised upon the nations of the West. An adequate treatment of this
highly interesting theme could only be presented in a special
volume.</p>
<p>The oldest trace of contact between the Indians and the peoples of
the West is to be found in the history of Indian writing, which, as we
have already seen (p. 16) was derived from a Semitic source, probably
as early as 800 B.C.</p>
<p>The Aryans having conquered Hindustan in prehistoric times, began
themselves to fall under foreign domination from an early period. The
extreme north-west became subject to Persian sway from about 500 to 331
B.C. under the Ach&aelig;menid dynasty. Cyrus the First made tributary
the Indian tribes of the Gandh&#257;ras and A&ccedil;vakas. The old
Persian inscriptions of Behistun and Persepolis show that his
successor, Darius Hystaspis, ruled over not only the Gandharians, but
also the people of the Indus. Herodotus also states that this monarch
had subjected the &ldquo;Northern Indians.&rdquo; At the command of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb409" href="#pb409" name=
"pb409">409</a>]</span>the same Darius, a Greek named Skylax is said to
have travelled in India, and to have navigated the Indus in 509 B.C.
From his account various Greek writers, among them Herodotus, derived
their information about India. In the army which Xerxes led against
Greece in 480 B.C. there were divisions of Gandharians and Indians,
whose dress and equipment are described by Herodotus. That historian
also makes the statement that the satrapy of India furnished the
heaviest tribute in the Persian empire, adding that the gold with which
it was paid was brought from a desert in the east, where it was dug up
by ants larger than foxes.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the fourth century B.C., the Greek physician
Ktesias, who resided at the court of Artaxerxes II., learnt much from
the Persians about India, and was personally acquainted with wise
Indians. Little useful information can, however, be derived from the
account of India which he wrote after his return in 398 B.C., as it has
been very imperfectly preserved, and his reputation for veracity did
not stand high among his countrymen.</p>
<p>The destruction of the Persian empire by Alexander the Great led to
a new invasion of India, which fixes the first absolutely certain date
in Indian history. In 327 B.C. Alexander passed over the Hindu Kush
with an army of 120,000 infantry and 30,000 cavalry. After taking the
town of Pushkalavat&#299; (the Greek Peukelaotis) at the confluence of
the Kabul and Indus, and subduing the A&ccedil;vakas (variously called
Assakanoi, Aspasioi, Hippasioi, by Greek writers) on the north and the
Gandh&#257;ras on the south of the Kabul River, he crossed the Indus
early in 326. At Taksha&ccedil;il&#257; (Greek Taxiles), between the
Indus and the Jhelum (Hydaspes), the Greeks for the first time saw
Brahman Yog&#299;s, or &ldquo;the wise men of the Indians,&rdquo; as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb410" href="#pb410" name=
"pb410">410</a>]</span>they called them, and were astonished at their
asceticism and strange doctrines.</p>
<p>Between the Jhelum and the Chenab (Akesines) lay the kingdom of the
Pauravas or Pauras, whose prince, called Porus by the Greeks from the
name of his people, led out an army of 50,000 infantry, 4000 cavalry,
200 elephants, and 400 chariots to check the advance of the invader.
Then on the banks of the Jhelum was fought the great historic battle,
in which Alexander, after a severe struggle, finally won the day by
superior numbers and force of genius. He continued his victorious march
eastwards till he reached the Sutlej (Greek Zadadres). But here his
further progress towards the Ganges was arrested by the opposition of
his Macedonians, intimidated by the accounts they heard of the great
power of the king of the Prasioi (Sanskrit Pr&#257;chyas, or
&ldquo;Easterns&rdquo;). Hence, after appointing satraps of the
Panj&#257;b and of Sindh, he sailed down to the mouths of the Indus and
returned to Persia by Gedrosia. Of the writings of those who
accompanied Alexander, nothing has been preserved except statements
from them in later authors.</p>
<p>After Alexander&rsquo;s death the assassination of the old king
Porus by Eudemus, the satrap of the Panj&#257;b, led to a rebellion in
which the Indians cast off the Greek yoke under the leadership of a
young adventurer named Chandragupta (the Sandrakottos or Sandrokyptos
of the Greeks). Having gained possession of the Indus territory in 317,
and dethroned the king of P&#257;&#7789;aliputra in 315 B.C., he became
master of the whole Ganges Valley as well. The Maurya dynasty, which he
thus founded, lasted for 137 years (315&ndash;178 B.C.). His empire was
the largest hitherto known in India, as it embraced the whole territory
between the Him&#257;laya and the Vindhya from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb411" href="#pb411" name="pb411">411</a>]</span>the
mouths of the Ganges to the Indus, including Gujarat.</p>
<p>Seleucus, who had founded a kingdom in Media and Persia, feeling
himself unable to vanquish Chandragupta, sent a Greek named Megasthenes
to reside at his court at P&#257;&#7789;aliputra. This ambassador thus
lived for several years in the heart of India between 311 and 302 B.C.,
and wrote a work entitled <i>Ta Indika</i>, which is particularly
valuable as the earliest direct record of his visit by a foreigner who
knew the country himself. Megasthenes furnishes particulars about the
strength of Chandragupta&rsquo;s army and the administration of the
state. He mentions forest ascetics (<i>Hylobioi</i>), and distinguishes
<i>Brachm&#257;nes</i> and <i>Sarmanai</i> as two classes of
philosophers, meaning, doubtless, Brahmans and Buddhists
(<i>&ccedil;rama&#7751;as</i>). He tells us that the Indians worshipped
the rain-bringing Zeus (Indra) as well as the Ganges, which must,
therefore, have already been a sacred river. By his description of the
god Dionysus, whom they worshipped in the mountains, &Ccedil;iva must
be intended, and by Herakles, adored in the plains, especially among
the &Ccedil;&#363;rasenas on the Yamun&#257; and in the city of
Methora, no other can be meant than Vish&#7751;u and his incarnation
K&#7771;ish&#7751;a, the chief city of whose tribe of Y&#257;davas was
Mathur&#257; (Muttra). These statements seem to justify the conclusion
that &Ccedil;iva and Vish&#7751;u were already prominent as highest
gods, the former in the mountains, the latter in the Ganges Valley.
K&#7771;ish&#7751;a would also seem to have been regarded as an
Avat&#257;r of Vish&#7751;u, though it is to be noted that
K&#7771;ish&#7751;a is not yet mentioned in the old Buddhist
S&#363;tras. We also learn from Megasthenes that the doctrine of the
four ages of the world (<i>yugas</i>) was fully developed in India by
his time. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb412" href="#pb412" name=
"pb412">412</a>]</span></p>
<p>Chandragupta&rsquo;s grandson, the famous A&ccedil;oka, not only
maintained his national Indian empire, but extended it in every
direction. Having adopted Buddhism as the state religion, he did much
to spread its doctrines, especially to Ceylon, which since then has
remained the most faithful guardian of Buddhist tradition.</p>
<p>After A&ccedil;oka&rsquo;s death the Gr&aelig;co-Bactrian princes
began about 200 B.C. to conquer Western India, and ruled there for
about eighty years. Euthydemos extended his dominions to the Jhelum.
His son Demetrios (early in the second century B.C.) appears to have
held sway over the Lower Indus, M&#257;lava, Gujarat, and probably also
Kashmir. He is called &ldquo;King of the Indians,&rdquo; and was the
first to introduce a bilingual coinage by adding an Indian inscription
in <i>Kharosh&#7789;h&#299;</i> characters on the reverse to the Greek
on the obverse. Eukratides (190&ndash;160 B.C.), who rebelled against
Demetrios, subjected the Panj&#257;b as far east as the Be&auml;s.
After the reign of Heliokles (160&ndash;120 B.C.), the Greek princes in
India ceased to be connected with Bactria. The most prominent among
these Gr&aelig;co-Indians was Menander (<i>c.</i> 150 B.C.), who, under
the name of Milinda, is well known in Buddhist writings. The last
vestige of Greek domination in India disappeared about 20 B.C., having
lasted nearly two centuries. It is a remarkable fact that no Greek
monumental inscriptions have ever been found in India.</p>
<p>With the beginning of the Gr&aelig;co-Indian period also commenced
the incursions of the Scythic tribes, who are called Indo-Scythians by
the Greeks, and by the Indians &Ccedil;akas, the Persian designation of
Scythians in general. Of these so-called Scythians the J&#257;ts of the
Panj&#257;b are supposed to be the descendants. The rule of these
&Ccedil;aka kings, the earliest of whom is Maues or Moa (<i>c.</i> 120
B.C.), <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb413" href="#pb413" name=
"pb413">413</a>]</span>endured down to 178 A.D., or about three
centuries. Their memory is preserved in India by the &Ccedil;aka era,
which is still in use, and dates from 78 A.D., the inaugural year of
Kanishka, the only famous king of this race. His dominions, which
included K&#257;nyakubja (Kanauj) on the Ganges, extended beyond the
confines of India to parts of Central Asia. A zealous adherent of
Buddhism, he made Gandh&#257;ra and Kashmir the chief seat of that
religion, and held the fourth Buddhist council in the latter
country.</p>
<p>About 20 B.C. the &Ccedil;akas were followed into India by the
Kushanas, who were one of the five tribes of the Yueh-chi from Central
Asia, and who subsequently conquered the whole of Northern India.</p>
<p>After having been again united into a single empire almost as great
as that of Chandragupta under the national dynasty of the Guptas, from
319 to 480 A.D., Northern India, partly owing to the attacks of the
H&#363;&#7751;as, was split up into several kingdoms, some under the
later Guptas, till 606 A.D., when Harshavardhana of Kanauj gained
paramount power over the whole of Northern India. During his reign the
poet B&#257;&#7751;a flourished, and the celebrated Chinese pilgrim
Hiouen Thsang visited India.</p>
<p>With the Muhammadan conquest about 1000 A.D. the country again fell
under a foreign yoke. As after Alexander&rsquo;s invasion, we have the
good fortune to possess in Alb&#275;r&#363;n&#299;&rsquo;s <i>India</i>
(<i>c.</i> 1030 A.D.) the valuable work of a cultivated foreigner,
giving a detailed account of the civilisation of India at this new era
in its history.</p>
<p>This repeated contact of the Indians with foreign invaders from the
West naturally led to mutual influences in various branches of
literature. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb414" href="#pb414" name=
"pb414">414</a>]</span></p>
<p>With regard to the Epics, we find the statement of the Greek
rhetorician Dio Chrysostomos (50&ndash;117 A.D.) that the Indians sang
in their own language the poetry of Homer, the sorrows of Priam, the
laments of Andromache and Hecuba, the valour of Achilles and Hector.
The similarity of some of the leading characters of the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>, to which the Greek writer evidently
alludes, caused him to suppose that the Indian epic was a translation
of the <i>Iliad</i>. There is, however, no connection <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e12421" title="Source: of of">of</span> any kind between
the two poems. Nor does Professor Weber&rsquo;s assumption of Greek
influence on the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> appear to have any
sufficient basis (p. 307).</p>
<p>The view has been held that the worship of K&#7771;ish&#7751;a, who,
as we have seen, plays an important part in the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>, arose under the influence of
Christianity, with which it certainly has some rather striking points
of resemblance. This theory is, however, rendered improbable, at least
as far as the origin of the cult of K&#7771;ish&#7751;a is concerned,
by the conclusions at which we have arrived regarding the age of the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> (pp. 286&ndash;287), as well as by the
statements of Megasthenes, which indicate that K&#7771;ish&#7751;a was
deified and worshipped some centuries before the beginning of our era.
We know, moreover, from the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;shya</i> that the story
of K&#7771;ish&#7751;a was the subject of dramatic representations in
the second or, at latest, the first century before the birth of
Christ.</p>
<p>It is an interesting question whether the Indian drama has any
genetic connection with that of Greece. It must be admitted that
opportunities for such a connection may have existed during the first
three centuries preceding our era. On his expedition to India,
Alexander was accompanied by numerous artists, among <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb415" href="#pb415" name="pb415">415</a>]</span>whom
there may have been actors. Seleucus gave his daughter in marriage to
Chandragupta, and both that ruler and Ptolemy II. maintained relations
with the court of P&#257;&#7789;aliputra by means of ambassadors. Greek
dynasties ruled in Western India for nearly two centuries. Alexandria
was connected by a lively commerce with the town called by the Greeks
Barygaza (now Broach), at the mouth of the Narmad&#257; (Nerbudda) in
Gujarat; with the latter town was united by a trade route the city of
Ujjayin&#299; (Greek Oz&#275;n&#275;), which in consequence reached a
high pitch of prosperity. Philostratus (second century A.D.), not it is
true a very trustworthy authority, states in his Life of Apollonius of
Tyana, who visited India about 50 A.D., that Greek literature was held
in high esteem by the Brahmans. Indian inscriptions mention Yavana or
Greek girls sent to India as tribute, and Sanskrit authors, especially
K&#257;lid&#257;sa, describe Indian princes as waited on by them.
Professor Weber has even conjectured that the Indian god of love,
K&#257;ma, bears a dolphin (<i>makara</i>) in his banner, like the
Greek Er&#333;s, through the influence of Greek courtesans.</p>
<p>The existence of such conditions has induced Professor Weber to
believe that the representations of Greek plays, which must have taken
place at the courts of Greek princes in Bactria, in the Panj&#257;b,
and in Gujarat, suggested the drama to the Indians as a subject for
imitation. This theory is supported by the fact that the curtain of the
Indian stage is called <i>yavanik&#257;</i> or the &ldquo;Greek
partition.&rdquo; Weber at the same time admits that there is no
internal connection between the Indian and the Greek drama.</p>
<p>Professor Windisch, however, went further, and maintained such
internal connection. It was, indeed, impossible <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb416" href="#pb416" name="pb416">416</a>]</span>for
him to point out any affinity to the Greek tragedy, but he thought he
could trace in the <i>M&#7771;icchaka&#7789;ik&#257;</i> the influence
of the new Attic comedy, which reached its zenith with Menander about
300 B.C. The points in which that play resembles this later Greek
comedy are fewer and slighter in other Sanskrit dramas, and can easily
be explained as independently developed in India. The improbability of
the theory is emphasised by the still greater affinity of the Indian
drama to that of Shakespeare. It is doubtful whether Greek plays were
ever actually performed in India; at any rate, no references to such
performances have been preserved. The earliest Sanskrit plays extant
are, moreover, separated from the Greek period by at least four hundred
years. The Indian drama has had a thoroughly national development, and
even its origin, though obscure, easily admits of an indigenous
explanation. The name of the curtain, <i>yavanik&#257;</i>, may,
indeed, be a reminiscence of Greek plays actually seen in India; but it
is uncertain whether the Greek theatre had a curtain at all; in any
case, it did not form the background of the stage.</p>
<p>It is a fact worth noting, that the beginning of one of the most
famous of modern European dramas has been modelled on that of a
celebrated Sanskrit play. The prelude of <i>&Ccedil;akuntal&#257;</i>
suggested to Goethe the plan of the prologue on the stage in
<i>Faust</i>, where the stage-manager, the merryandrew, and the poet
converse regarding the play about to be performed (<i>cf.</i> p. 351).
Forster&rsquo;s German translation of K&#257;lid&#257;sa&rsquo;s
masterpiece appeared in 1791, and the profound impression it produced
on Goethe is proved by the well-known epigram he composed on
<i>&Ccedil;akuntal&#257;</i> in the same year. The impression was a
lasting one; for the theatre prologue <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb417" href="#pb417" name="pb417">417</a>]</span>of <i>Faust</i> was
not written till 1797, and as late as 1830 the poet thought of adapting
the Indian play for the Weimar stage.</p>
<p>If in epic and dramatic poetry hardly any definite influences can be
traced between India and the West, how different is the case in the
domain of fables and fairy tales! The story of the migration of these
from India certainly forms the most romantic chapter in the literary
history of the world.</p>
<p>We know that in the sixth century A.D. there existed in India a
Buddhist collection of fables, in which animals play the part of human
beings (<i>cf.</i> p. 369). By the command of the Sassanian king,
Khosru An&#363;sh&#299;rv&#257;n (531&ndash;579), this work was
translated by a Persian physician named Barzoi into Pehlev&#299;. Both
this version and the unmodified original have been lost, but two early
and notable translations from the Pehlev&#299; have been preserved. The
Syriac one was made about 570 A.D., and called <i>Kal&#299;lag and
Damnag</i>. A manuscript of it was found by chance in 1870, and,
becoming known to scholars by a wonderful chapter of lucky accidents,
was published in 1876. The Arabic translation from the Pehlev&#299;,
entitled <i>Kal&#299;lah and Dimnah</i>, or &ldquo;Fables of
Pilpay,&rdquo; was made in the eighth century by a Persian convert to
Islam, who died about 760 A.D. In this translation a wicked king is
represented to be reclaimed to virtue by a Brahman philosopher named
<i>Bidbah</i>, a word which has been satisfactorily traced through
Pehlev&#299; to the Sanskrit <i>vidy&#257;pati</i>, &ldquo;master of
sciences,&rdquo; &ldquo;chief scholar.&rdquo; From this <i>bidbah</i>
is derived the modern Bidpai or Pilpay, which is thus not a proper name
at all.</p>
<p>This Arabic version is of great importance, as the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb418" href="#pb418" name=
"pb418">418</a>]</span>source of other versions which exercised very
great influence in shaping the literature of the Middle Ages in Europe.
These versions of it were the later Syriac (<i>c.</i> 1000 A.D.), the
Greek (1180), the Persian (<i>c.</i> 1130), recast later (<i>c.</i>
1494) under the title of <i>Anv&#257;r-i-Suhail&#299;</i>, or
&ldquo;Lights of Canopus,&rdquo; the old Spanish (1251), and the Hebrew
one made about 1250.</p>
<p>The fourth stratum of translation is represented by John of
Capua&rsquo;s rendering of the Hebrew version into Latin (<i>c.</i>
1270), entitled <i lang="la">Directorium Human&aelig; Vit&aelig;</i>
which was printed about 1480.</p>
<p>From John of Capua&rsquo;s work was made, at the instance of Duke
Eberhardt of W&uuml;rtemberg, the famous German version, <i lang=
"de">Das Buch der Byspel der alten Wysen</i>, or &ldquo;Book of
Apologues of the Ancient Sages,&rdquo; first printed about 1481. The
fact that four dated editions appeared at Ulm between 1483 and 1485,
and thirteen more down to 1592, is a sufficiently eloquent proof of the
importance of this work as a means of instruction and amusement during
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The <i lang="la">Directorium</i>
was also the source of the Italian version, printed at Venice in 1552,
from which came the English translation of Sir Thomas North (1570). The
latter was thus separated from the Indian original by five intervening
translations and a thousand years of time.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note the changes which tales undergo in the
course of such wanderings. In the second edition of his Fables (1678),
La Fontaine acknowledges his indebtedness for a large part of his work
to the Indian sage Pilpay. A well-known story in the French writer is
that of the milkmaid, who, while carrying a pail of milk on her head to
market, and building all kinds of castles in the air with the future
proceeds <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb419" href="#pb419" name=
"pb419">419</a>]</span>of the sale of the milk, suddenly gives a jump
of joy at the prospect of her approaching fortune, and thereby shatters
the pail to pieces on the ground. This is only a transformation of a
story still preserved in the <i>Panchatantra</i>. Here it is a Brahman
who, having filled an alms-bowl with the remnants of some rice-pap he
has begged, hangs it up on a nail in the wall above his bed. He dreams
of the money he will procure by selling the rice when a famine breaks
out. Then he will gradually acquire cattle, buy a fine house, and marry
a beautiful girl with a rich dowry. One day when he calls to his wife
to take away his son who is playing about, and she does not hear, he
will rise up to give her a kick. As this thought passes through his
mind, his foot shatters the alms-bowl, the contents of which are spilt
all over him.</p>
<p>Another <i>Panchatantra</i> story recurring in La Fontaine is that
of the too avaricious jackal. Finding the dead bodies of a boar and a
hunter, besides the bow of the latter, he resolves on devouring the
bowstring first. As soon as he begins to gnaw, the bow starts asunder,
pierces his head, and kills him. In La Fontaine the jackal has become a
wolf, and the latter is killed by the arrow shot off as he touches the
bow.</p>
<p>Nothing, perhaps, in the history of the migration of Indian tales is
more remarkable than the story of <i>Barlaam and Josaphat</i>. At the
court of Khalif Almansur (753&ndash;774), under whom <i>Kal&#299;lah
and Dimnah</i> was translated into Arabic, there lived a Christian
known as John of Damascus, who wrote in Greek the story of <i>Barlaam
and Josaphat</i> as a manual of Christian theology. This became one of
the most popular books of the Middle Ages, being translated into many
Oriental as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb420" href="#pb420" name=
"pb420">420</a>]</span>well as European languages. It is enlivened by a
number of fables and parables, most of which have been traced to Indian
sources. The very hero of the story, Prince Josaphat, has an Indian
origin, being, in fact, no other than Buddha. The name has been shown
to be a corruption of <i>Bodhisattva</i>, a well-known designation of
the Indian reformer. Josaphat rose to the rank of a saint both in the
Greek and the Roman Church, his day in the former being August 26, in
the latter November 27. That the founder of an atheistic Oriental
religion should have developed into a Christian saint is one of the
most astounding facts in religious history.</p>
<p>Though Europe was thus undoubtedly indebted to India for its
medi&aelig;val literature of fairy tales and fables, the Indian claim
to priority of origin in ancient times is somewhat dubious. A certain
number of apologues found in the collections of &AElig;sop and Babrius
are distinctly related to Indian fables. The Indian claim is supported
by the argument that the relation of the jackal to the lion is a
natural one in the Indian fable, while the connection of the fox and
the lion in Greece has no basis in fact. On the other side it has been
urged that animals and birds which are peculiar to India play but a
minor part in Indian fables, while there exists a Greek representation
of the &AElig;sopian fable of the fox and the raven, dating from the
sixth century B.C. Weber and Benfey both conclude that the Indians
borrowed a few fables from the Greeks, admitting at the same time that
the Indians had independent fables of their own before. Rudimentary
fables are found even in the <i>Chh&#257;ndogya Upanishad</i>, and the
transmigration theory would have favoured the development of this
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb421" href="#pb421" name=
"pb421">421</a>]</span>form of tale; indeed Buddha himself in the old
<i>J&#257;taka</i> stories appears in the form of various animals.</p>
<p>Contemporaneously with the fable literature, the most intellectual
game the world has known began its westward migration from India. Chess
in Sanskrit is called <i>chatur-anga</i>, or the &ldquo;four-limbed
army,&rdquo; because it represents a <i>kriegspiel</i>, in which two
armies, consisting of infantry, cavalry, chariots, and elephants, each
led by a king and his councillor, are opposed. The earliest direct
mention of the game in Sanskrit literature is found in the works of
B&#257;&#7751;a, and the <i>K&#257;vy&#257;lam&#803;k&#257;ra</i> of
Rudra&#7789;a, a Kashmirian poet of the ninth century, contains a
metrical puzzle illustrating the moves of the chariot, the elephant,
and the horse. Introduced into Persia in the sixth century, chess was
brought by the Arabs to Europe, where it was generally known by 1100
A.D. It has left its mark on medi&aelig;val poetry, on the idioms of
European languages (<i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;check,&rdquo; from the Persian
<i>shah</i>, &ldquo;king&rdquo;), on the science of arithmetic in the
calculation of progressions with the chessboard, and even in heraldry,
where the &ldquo;rook&rdquo; often figures in coats of arms. Beside the
fable literature of India, this Indian game served to while away the
tedious life of myriads during the Middle Ages in Europe.</p>
<p>Turning to Philosophical Literature, we find that the early Greek
and Indian philosophers have many points in common. Some of the leading
doctrines of the Eleatics, that God and the universe are one, that
everything existing in multiplicity has no reality, that thinking and
being are identical, are all to be found in the philosophy of the
Upanishads and the Ved&#257;nta system, which is its outcome. Again,
the doctrine of Empedocles, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb422" href=
"#pb422" name="pb422">422</a>]</span>that nothing can arise which has
not existed before, and that nothing existing can be annihilated, has
its exact parallel in the characteristic doctrine of the S&#257;nkhya
system about the eternity and indestructibility of matter. According to
Greek tradition, Thales, Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Democritus, and others
undertook journeys to Oriental countries in order to study philosophy.
Hence there is at least the historical possibility of the Greeks having
been influenced by Indian thought through Persia.</p>
<p>Whatever may be the truth in the cases just mentioned, the
dependence of Pythagoras on Indian philosophy and science certainly
seems to have a high degree of probability. Almost all the doctrines
ascribed to him, religious, philosophical, mathematical, were known in
India in the sixth century B.C. The coincidences are so numerous that
their cumulative force becomes considerable. The transmigration theory,
the assumption of five elements, the Pythagorean theorem in geometry,
the prohibition as to eating beans, the religio-philosophical character
of the Pythagorean fraternity, and the mystical speculations of the
Pythagorean school, all have their close parallels in ancient India.
The doctrine of metempsychosis in the case of Pythagoras appears
without any connection or explanatory background, and was regarded by
the Greeks as of foreign origin. He could not have derived it from
Egypt, as it was not known to the ancient Egyptians. In spite, however,
of the later tradition, it seems impossible that Pythagoras should have
made his way to India at so early a date, but he could quite well have
met Indians in Persia.</p>
<p>Coming to later centuries, we find indications that the
Neo-Platonist philosophy may have been influenced by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb423" href="#pb423" name="pb423">423</a>]</span>the
S&#257;nkhya system, which flourished in the first centuries of our
era, and could easily have become known at Alexandria owing to the
lively intercourse between that city and India at the time. From this
source Plotinus (204&ndash;269 A.D.), chief of the Neo-Platonists, may
have derived his doctrine that soul is free from suffering, which
belongs only to matter, his identification of soul with light, and his
illustrative use of the mirror, in which the reflections of objects
appear, for the purpose of explaining the phenomena of consciousness.
The influence of the Yoga system on Plotinus is suggested by his
requirement that man should renounce the world of sense and strive
after truth by contemplation. Connection with S&#257;nkhya ideas is
still more likely in the case of Plotinus&rsquo;s most eminent pupil,
Porphyry (232&ndash;304 A.D.), who lays particular stress on the
difference between soul and matter, on the omnipresence of soul when
freed from the bonds of matter, and on the doctrine that the world has
no beginning. It is also noteworthy that he rejects sacrifice and
prohibits the killing of animals.</p>
<p>The influence of Indian philosophy on Christian Gnosticism in the
second and third centuries seems at any rate undoubted. The Gnostic
doctrine of the opposition between soul and matter, of the personal
existence of intellect, will, and so forth, the identification of soul
and light, are derived from the S&#257;nkhya system. The division,
peculiar to several Gnostics, of men into the three classes of
<i>pneumatikoi</i>, <i>psychikoi</i>, and <i>hylikoi</i>, is also based
on the S&#257;nkhya doctrine of the three <i>gu&#7751;as</i>. Again,
Bardesanes, a Gnostic of the Syrian school, who obtained information
about India from Indian philosophers, assumed the existence of a subtle
ethereal body <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb424" href="#pb424" name=
"pb424">424</a>]</span>which is identical with the
<i>linga-&ccedil;ar&#299;ra</i> of the S&#257;nkhya system. Finally,
the many heavens of the Gnostics are evidently derived from the
fantastic cosmogony of later Buddhism.</p>
<p>With regard to the present century, the influence of Indian thought
on the pessimistic philosophy of Schopenhauer and Von Hartmann is well
known. How great an impression the Upanishads produced on the former,
even in a second-hand Latin translation, may be inferred from his
writing that they were his consolation in life and would be so in
death.</p>
<p>In Science, too, the debt of Europe to India has been considerable.
There is, in the first place, the great fact that the Indians invented
the numerical figures used all over the world. The influence which the
decimal system of reckoning dependent on those figures has had not only
on mathematics, but on the progress of civilisation in general, can
hardly be over-estimated. During the eighth and ninth centuries the
Indians became the teachers in arithmetic and algebra of the Arabs, and
through them of the nations of the West. Thus, though we call the
latter science by an Arabic name, it is a gift we owe to India.</p>
<p>In Geometry the points of contact between the &Ccedil;ulva
S&#363;tras and the work of the Greeks are so considerable, that,
according to Cantor, the historian of mathematics, borrowing must have
taken place on one side or the other. In the opinion of that authority,
the &Ccedil;ulva S&#363;tras were influenced by the Alexandrian
geometry of Hero (215 B.C.), which, he thinks, came to India after 100
B.C. The &Ccedil;ulva S&#363;tras are, however, probably far earlier
than that date, for they form an integral portion of the &Ccedil;rauta
S&#363;tras, and their geometry is a part of the Brahmanical theology,
having taken its rise in India from practical <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb425" href="#pb425" name=
"pb425">425</a>]</span>motives as much as the science of grammar. The
prose parts of the Yajurvedas and the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as constantly
speak of the arrangement of the sacrificial ground and the construction
of altars according to very strict rules, the slightest deviation from
which might cause the greatest disaster. It is not likely that the
exclusive Brahmans should have been willing to borrow anything closely
connected with their religion from foreigners.</p>
<p>Of Astronomy the ancient Indians had but slight independent
knowledge. It is probable that they derived their early acquaintance
with the twenty-eight divisions of the moon&rsquo;s orbit from the
Chaldeans through their commercial relations with the Ph&oelig;nicians.
Indian astronomy did not really begin to flourish till it was affected
by that of Greece; it is indeed the one science in which undoubtedly
strong Greek influence can be proved. The debt which the native
astronomers always acknowledge they owe to the Yavanas is sufficiently
obvious from the numerous Greek terms in Indian astronomical writings.
Thus, in Var&#257;ha Mihira&rsquo;s <i>Hor&#257;-&ccedil;&#257;stra</i>
the signs of the zodiac are enumerated either by Sanskrit names
translated from the Greek or by the original Greek names, as
<i>&#256;ra</i> for <i>Ares</i>, <i>Heli</i> for <i>H&#275;lios</i>,
<i>Jyau</i> for <i>Zeus</i>. Many technical terms were directly
borrowed from Greek works, as <i>kendra</i> for <i>kentron</i>,
<i>j&#257;mitra</i> for <i>diametron</i>. Some of the very names of the
oldest astronomical treatises of the Indians indicate their Western
origin. Thus the <i>Romaka-siddh&#257;nta</i> means the &ldquo;Roman
manual.&rdquo; The title of Var&#257;ha Mihira&rsquo;s
<i>Hor&#257;-&ccedil;&#257;stra</i> contains the Greek word
<i>h&#333;r&#257;</i>.</p>
<p>In a few respects, however, the Indians independently advanced
astronomical science further than the Greeks themselves, and at a later
period they in their turn <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb426" href=
"#pb426" name="pb426">426</a>]</span>influenced the West even in
astronomy. For in the eighth and ninth centuries they became the
teachers of the Arabs in this science also. The <i>siddh&#257;ntas</i>
(Arabic <i>Sind Hind</i>), the writings of &#256;ryabha&#7789;a (called
Arjeh&#299;r), and the <i>Aharga&#7751;a</i> (<i>Arkand</i>),
attributed to Brahmagupta, were translated or adapted by the Arabs, and
Khalifs of Bagdad repeatedly summoned Indian astronomers to their court
to supervise this work. Through the Arabs, Indian astronomy then
migrated to Europe, which in this case only received back in a
roundabout way what it had given long before. Thus the Sanskrit word
<i>uchcha</i>, &ldquo;apex of a planet&rsquo;s orbit,&rdquo; was
borrowed in the form of <i>aux</i> (gen. <i>aug-is</i>) in Latin
translations of Arabic astronomers.</p>
<p>After Bh&#257;skara (twelfth century), Hindu astronomy, ceasing to
make further progress, became once more merged in the astrology from
which it had sprung. It was now the turn of the Arabs, and, by a
strange inversion of things, an Arabic writer of the ninth century who
had written on Indian astronomy and arithmetic, in this period became
an object of study to the Hindus. The old Greek terms remained, but new
Arabic ones were added as the necessity for them arose.</p>
<p>The question as to whether Indian Medical Science in its earlier
period was affected by that of the Greeks cannot yet be answered with
certainty, the two systems not having hitherto been compared with
sufficient care. Recently, however, some close parallels have been
discovered between the works of Hippocrates and Charaka (according to a
Chinese authority, the official physician of King Kanishka), which
render Greek influence before the beginning of our era likely.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the effect of Hindu medical <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb427" href="#pb427" name=
"pb427">427</a>]</span>science upon the Arabs after about 700 A.D. was
considerable, for the Khalifs of Bagdad caused several books on the
subject to be translated. The works of Charaka and Su&ccedil;ruta
(probably not later than the fourth century A.D.) were rendered into
Arabic at the close of the eighth century, and are quoted as
authorities by the celebrated Arabic physician Al-Razi, who died in 932
A.D. Arabic medicine in its turn became the chief authority, down to
the seventeenth century, of European physicians. By the latter Indian
medical authors must have been thought highly of, for Charaka is
repeatedly mentioned in the Latin translations of the Arab writers
Avicenna (Ibn S&#299;n&#257;), Rhazes (Al-Razi), and Serapion (Ibn
Sar&#257;fy&#363;n). In modern days European surgery has borrowed the
operation of rhinoplasty, or the formation of artificial noses, from
India, where Englishmen became acquainted with the art in the last
century.</p>
<p>We have already seen that the discovery of the Sanskrit language and
literature led, in the present century, to the foundation of the two
new sciences of Comparative Mythology and Comparative Philology.
Through the latter it has even affected the practical school-teaching
of the classical languages in Europe. The interest in Buddhism has
already produced an immense literature in Europe. Some of the finest
lyrics of Heine, and works like Sir Edwin Arnold&rsquo;s <i>Light of
Asia</i>, to mention only a few instances, have drawn their inspiration
from Sanskrit poetry. The intellectual debt of Europe to Sanskrit
literature has thus been undeniably great; it may perhaps become
greater still in the years that are to come. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On Sanskrit legal literature in general, consult the
very valuable work of Jolly, <i lang="de">Recht und Sitte</i>, in
B&uuml;hler&rsquo;s <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia</i>, 1896 (complete
bibliography). There are several secondary Dharma S&#363;tras of the
post-Vedic period. The most important of these is the
<i>Vaish&#7751;ava Dharma &Ccedil;&#257;stra</i> or <i>Vish&#7751;u
Sm&#7771;iti</i> (closely connected with the <i>K&#257;&#7789;haka
G&#7771;ihya S&#363;tra</i>), not earlier than 200 A.D. in its final
redaction (ed. by Jolly, Calcutta, 1881, trans. by him in the <i>Sacred
Books of the East</i>, Oxford, 1880). The regular post-Vedic lawbooks
are metrical (mostly in <i>&ccedil;lokas</i>). They are much wider in
scope than the Dharma S&#363;tras, which are limited to matters
connected with religion. The most important and earliest of the
metrical Sm&#7771;itis is the <i>M&#257;nava Dharma
&Ccedil;&#257;stra</i>, or <i>Code of Manu</i>, not improbably based on
a <i>M&#257;nava Dharma S&#363;tra</i>. It is closely connected with
the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>, of which three books alone (iii.,
xii., xvi.) contain as many as 260 of its 2684 <i>&ccedil;lokas</i>. It
probably assumed its present shape not much later than 200 A.D. It was
ed. by Jolly, London, 1887; trans. by B&uuml;hler, with valuable
introd., in the <i>Sacred Books</i>, Oxford, 1886; also trans. by
Burnell (ed. by Hopkins), London, 1884; text ed., with seven comm., by
Mandlik, Bombay, 1886; text, with Kull&#363;ka&rsquo;s comm., Bombay,
1888, better than Nirn. S&#257;g. Pr., ed. 1887. Next comes the
<i>Y&#257;jnavalkya Dharma &Ccedil;&#257;stra</i>, which is much more
concise (1009 <i>&ccedil;lokas</i>). It was probably based on a Dharma
S&#363;tra of the <i>White <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb429" href=
"#pb429" name="pb429">429</a>]</span>Yajurveda</i>; its third section
resembles the <i>P&#257;raskara G&#7771;ihya S&#363;tra</i>, but it is
unmistakably connected with the <i>M&#257;nava G&#7771;ihya
S&#363;tra</i> of the <i>Black Yajurveda</i>. Its approximate date
seems to be about 350 A.D. Its author probably belonged to
Mithil&#257;, capital of Videha (Tirhut). <i>Y&#257;jnavalkya</i>, ed.
and trans, by Stenzler, Berlin, 1849; with comm.
<i>Mit&#257;kshar&#257;</i>, 3rd ed., Bombay, 1892. The <i>N&#257;rada
Sm&#7771;iti</i> is the first to limit <i>dharma</i> to law in the
strict sense. It contains more than 12,000 <i>&ccedil;lokas</i>, and
appears to have been founded chiefly on <i>Manu</i>. B&#257;&#7751;a
mentions a <i>N&#257;rad&#299;ya Dharma &Ccedil;&#257;stra</i>, and
N&#257;rada was annotated by one of the earliest legal commentators in
the eighth century. His date is probably about 500 A.D.
<i>N&#257;rada</i>, ed. by Jolly, Calcutta, 1885, trans. by him in
<i>Sacred Books</i>, vol. xxxiii. 1889. A late lawbook is the
<i>Par&#257;&ccedil;ara Sm&#7771;iti</i> (anterior to 1300 A.D.), ed.
in Bombay Sansk. Series, 1893; trans. <i>Bibl. Ind.</i>, 1887. The
second stage of post-Vedic legal literature is formed by the
commentaries. The oldest one preserved is that of Medh&#257;tithi on
<i>Manu</i>; he dates from about 900 A.D. The most famous comm. on
<i>Manu</i> is that of Kull&#363;ka-bha&#7789;&#7789;a, composed at
Benares in the fifteenth century, but it is nothing more than a
plagiarism of Govindar&#257;ja, a commentator of the twelfth century.
The most celebrated comm. on <i>Y&#257;jnavalkya</i> is the
<i>Mit&#257;kshar&#257;</i> of Vijn&#257;ne&ccedil;vara, composed about
1100 A.D. It early attained to the position of a standard work, not
only in the Dekhan, but even in Benares and a great part of Northern
India. In the present century it acquired the greatest importance in
the practice of the Anglo-Indian law-courts through Colebrooke&rsquo;s
translation of the section which it contains on the law of inheritance.
From about 1000 A.D. onwards, an innumerable multitude of legal
compendia, called <i>Dharma-nibandhas</i>, was produced in India. The
most imposing of them is the voluminous work in five <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb430" href="#pb430" name=
"pb430">430</a>]</span>parts entitled
<i>Chaturvarga-chint&#257;ma&#7751;i</i>, composed by Hem&#257;dri
about 1300 A.D. It hardly treats of law at all, but is a perfect mine
of interesting quotations from the Sm&#7771;itis and the
Pur&#257;&#7751;as; it has been edited in the <i>Bibl. Ind.</i> The
<i>Dharmaratna</i> of J&#299;m&#363;tav&#257;hana (probably fifteenth
century) may here be mentioned, because part of it is the famous
treatise on the law of inheritance entitled <i>D&#257;yabh&#257;ga</i>,
which is the chief work of the Bengal School on the subject, and was
translated by Colebrooke. It should be noted that the Indian
Sm&#7771;itis are not on the same footing as the lawbooks of other
nations, but are works of private individuals; they were also written
by Brahmans for Brahmans, whose caste pretensions they consequently
exaggerate. It is therefore important to check their statements by
outside evidence.</p>

<p class="first">No work of a directly historical character is met with
in Sanskrit literature till after the Muhammadan conquest. This is the
<i>R&#257;jatarangi&#7751;&#299;</i>, or &ldquo;River of Kings,&rdquo;
a chronicle of the kings of Kashmir, begun by its author,
Kalha&#7751;a, in 1148 A.D. It contains nearly 8000
<i>&ccedil;lokas</i>. The early part of the work is legendary in
character. The poet does not become historical till he approaches his
own times. This work (ed. M. A. Stein, Bombay, 1892; trans, by Y. C.

<p class="first">On the native grammatical literature see especially
Wackernagel, <i lang="de">Altindische Grammatik</i>, vol. i. p. lix.
<i>sqq</i>. The oldest grammar preserved is that of P&#257;&#7751;ini,
who, however, mentions no fewer than sixty-four predecessors.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb431" href="#pb431" name=
"pb431">431</a>]</span>He belonged to the extreme north-west of India,
and probably flourished about 300 B.C. His work consists of nearly 4000
s&#363;tras divided into eight chapters; text with German trans., ed.
by B&ouml;htlingk, Leipsic, 1887. P&#257;&#7751;ini had before him a
list of irregularly formed words, which survives, in a somewhat
modified form, as the <i>U&#7751;&#257;di S&#363;tra</i> (ed. by
Aufrecht, with Ujjvaladatta&rsquo;s comm., Bonn, 1859). There are also
two appendixes to which P&#257;&#7751;ini refers: one is the
<i>Dh&#257;tup&#257;&#7789;ha</i>, &ldquo;List of Verbal Roots,&rdquo;
containing some 2000 roots, of which only about 800 have been found in
Sanskrit literature, and from which about fifty Vedic verbs are
omitted; the second is the <i>Ga&#7751;ap&#257;&#7789;ha</i>, or
&ldquo;List of Word-Groups,&rdquo; to which certain rules apply. These
<i>ga&#7751;as</i> were metrically arranged in the
<i>Ga&#7751;aratna-mahodadhi</i>, composed by Vardham&#257;na in 1140
A.D. (ed. by Eggeling, London, 1879). Among the earliest attempts to
explain P&#257;&#7751;ini was the formulation of rules of
interpretation or <i>paribh&#257;sh&#257;s</i>; a collection of these
was made in the last century by N&#257;gojibha&#7789;&#7789;a in his
<i>Paribh&#257;shendu&ccedil;ekhara</i> (ed. by Kielhorn, Bombay Sansk.
Ser., 1868 and 1871). Next we have the <i>V&#257;rttikas</i> or
&ldquo;Notes&rdquo; of K&#257;ty&#257;yana (probably third century
B.C.) on 1245 of P&#257;&#7751;ini&rsquo;s rules, and, somewhat later,
numerous grammatical <i>K&#257;rik&#257;s</i> or comments in metrical
form: all this critical work was collected by Patanjali in his
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;shya</i> or &ldquo;Great Commentary,&rdquo; with
supplementary comments of his own (ed. Kielhorn, 3 vols., Bombay). He
deals with 1713 rules of P&#257;&#7751;ini. He probably lived in the
later half of the second century B.C., and in any case not later than
the beginning of our era. The <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;shya</i> was
commented on in the seventh century by Bhart&#7771;ihari in his
<i>V&#257;kyapad&#299;ya</i> (ed. in Benares Sansk. Ser.), which is
concerned with the philosophy of grammar, and by Kaiya&#7789;a
(probably thirteenth century). About 650 A.D. was composed the

1898). In the fifteenth century R&#257;machandra, in his
<i>Prakriy&#257;-kaumud&#299;</i>, or &ldquo;Moonlight of
Method,&rdquo; endeavoured to make P&#257;&#7751;ini&rsquo;s grammar
easier by a more practical arrangement of its matter.
Bha&#7789;&#7789;oji&rsquo;s <i>Siddh&#257;nta-kaumud&#299;</i>
(seventeenth century) has a similar aim (ed. Nir&#7751;aya S&#257;gara
Press, Bombay, 1894); an abridgment of this work, the
<i>Laghu-kaumud&#299;</i>, by Varadar&#257;ja (ed. Ballantyne, with
English trans., 4th ed., Benares, 1891), is commonly used as an
introduction to the native system of grammar. Among
non-P&#257;&#7751;inean grammarians may be mentioned Chandra (about 600
A.D.), the pseudo-&Ccedil;&#257;ka&#7789;&#257;yana (later than the
<i>K&#257;&ccedil;ik&#257;</i>), and, the most important, Hemachandra
(12th cent.), author of a Pr&#257;krit grammar (ed. and trans. by
Pischel, two vols., Halle, 1877&ndash;80), and of the
<i>U&#7751;&#257;diga&#7751;a S&#363;tra</i> (ed. Kirste, Vienna,
1895). The <i>K&#257;tantra</i> of &Ccedil;arvavarman (ed. Eggeling,
<i>Bibl. Ind.</i>) seems to have been the most influential of the later
grammars. Vararuchi&rsquo;s
<i>Pr&#257;k&#7771;ita-prak&#257;&ccedil;a</i> is a Pr&#257;krit
grammar (ed. by Cowell, 2nd ed., 1868). The <i>Mugdhabodha</i> (13th
cent.) of Vopadeva is the Sanskrit grammar chiefly used in Bengal. The
<i>Phi&#7789; S&#363;tra</i> (later than Patanjali) gives rules for the
accentuation of nouns (ed. Kielhorn, 1866); Hemachandra&rsquo;s
<i>Ling&#257;nu&ccedil;&#257;sana</i> is a treatise on gender (ed.
Franke, G&ouml;ttingen, 1886). Among European grammars that of Whitney
was the first to attempt a historical treatment of the Vedic and
Sanskrit language. The first grammar treating Sanskrit from the
comparative point of view is the excellent work of Wackernagel, of
which, however, only the first part (phonology) has yet appeared. The
present writer&rsquo;s abridgment (London, 1886) of Max
M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s Sanskrit Grammar is a practical work for the use of
beginners of Classical Sanskrit. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb433"

W&ouml;rterb&uuml;cher</i> (in B&uuml;hler&rsquo;s
<i>Encyclop&aelig;dia</i>, 1897) deals with the subject as a whole
(complete bibliography). The Sanskrit dictionaries or
<i>ko&ccedil;as</i> are collections of rare words or significations for
the use of poets. They are all versified; alphabetical order is
entirely absent in the synonymous and only incipient in the homonymous
class. The <i>Amarako&ccedil;a</i> (ed. with Mahe&ccedil;vara&rsquo;s
comm., Bombay), occupies the same dominant position in lexicography as
P&#257;&#7751;ini in grammar, not improbably composed about 500 A.D. A
supplement to it is the <i>Trik&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a-&ccedil;esha</i>
by Purushottamadeva (perhaps as late as 1300 A.D.).
&Ccedil;&#257;&ccedil;vata&rsquo;s <i>Anek&#257;rtha-samuchchaya</i>
(ed. Zachari&aelig;, 1882) is possibly older than <i>Amara</i>.
Hal&#257;yudha&rsquo;s <i>Abhidh&#257;naratnam&#257;l&#257;</i> dates
from about 950 A.D. (ed. Aufrecht, London, 1861). About a century later
is Y&#257;davaprak&#257;&ccedil;a&rsquo;s <i>Vaijayant&#299;</i> (ed.
Oppert, Madras, 1893). The <i>Vi&ccedil;vaprak&#257;&ccedil;a</i> of
Mahe&ccedil;vara Kavi dates from 1111 A.D. The
<i>Mankha-ko&ccedil;a</i> (ed. Zachari&aelig;, Bombay, 1897) was
composed in Kashmir about 1150 A.D. Hemachandra (1088&ndash;1172 A.D.)
composed four dictionaries:
<i>Abhidh&#257;na-chint&#257;ma&#7751;i</i>, synonyms (ed.
B&ouml;htlingk and Rieu, St. Petersburg, 1847);
<i>Anek&#257;rtha-sam&#803;graha</i>, homonyms (ed. Zachari&aelig;,
Vienna, 1893); <i>De&ccedil;&#299;n&#257;mam&#257;l&#257;</i>, a
Pr&#257;krit dictionary (ed. Pischel, Bombay, 1880); and
<i>Nigha&#7751;&#7789;u-&ccedil;esha</i>, a botanical glossary, which

which probably goes back to the sixth century A.D. (ed. in
<i>K&#257;vyam&#257;l&#257;</i>, No. 42, Bombay, 1894; ed. by Grosset,

<h3 class="main">Mathematics and Astronomy.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The only work dealing with this subject as a whole is
Thibaut&rsquo;s <i lang="de">Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik</i>,
in B&uuml;hler-Kielhorn&rsquo;s <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia</i>, 1899 (full
bibliography). See also Cantor, <i lang="de">Geschichte der
Mathematik</i>, pp. 505&ndash;562, Leipsic, 1880. Mathematics are dealt
with in special chapters of the works of the early Indian astronomers.
In algebra they attained an eminence far exceeding anything ever
achieved by the Greeks. The earliest works of scientific Indian
astronomy (after about 300 A.D.) were four treatises called
<i>Siddh&#257;ntas</i>; only one, the <i>S&#363;ryasiddh&#257;nta</i>
(ed. and trans. by Whitney, <i>Journ. Am. Or. Soc.</i>, vol. vi.), has
survived. The doctrines of such early works were <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb435" href="#pb435" name=
"pb435">435</a>]</span>reduced to a more concise and practical form by
&#256;ryabha&#7789;a, born, as he tells us himself, at
P&#257;&#7789;aliputra in 476 A.D. He maintained the rotation of the
earth round its axis (a doctrine not unknown to the Greeks), and
explained the cause of eclipses of the sun and moon. Mathematics are
treated in the third section of his work, the
<i>&#256;ryabha&#7789;iya</i> (ed. with comm. by Kern, Leyden, 1874;
math. section trans. by Rodet, <i>Journal Asiatique</i>, 1879).
Var&#257;ha Mihira, born near Ujjain, began his calculations about 505
A.D., and, according to one of his commentators, died in 587 A.D. He
composed four works, written for the most part in the
<i>&#256;ry&#257;</i> metre; three are astrological: the
<i>B&#7771;ihat-sam&#803;hit&#257;</i> (ed. Kern, <i>Bibl. Ind.</i>,
1864, 1865, trans. in <i>Journ. As. Soc.</i>, vol. iv.; new ed. with
comm. of Bha&#7789;&#7789;otpala by S. Dvived&#299;, Benares,
1895&ndash;97), the <i>B&#7771;ihaj-j&#257;taka</i> (or
<i>Hor&#257;-&ccedil;&#257;stra</i>, trans. by C. Jyer, Madras, 1885),
and the <i>Laghu-j&#257;taka</i> (partly trans. by Weber, <i>Ind.
Stud.</i>, vol. ii., and by Jacobi, 1872). His
<i>Pancha-siddh&#257;ntik&#257;</i> (ed. and for the most part trans.
by Thibaut and S. Dvived&#299;, Benares, 1889), based on five
<i>siddh&#257;ntas</i>, is a <i>kara&#7751;a</i> or practical
astronomical treatise. Another distinguished astronomer was
Brahmagupta, who, born in 598 A.D., wrote, besides a
<i>kara&#7751;a</i>, his <i>Br&#257;hma Sphu&#7789;a-siddh&#257;nta</i>
when thirty years old (chaps. xii. and xviii. are mathematical). The
last eminent Indian astronomer was Bh&#257;skar&#257;ch&#257;rya, born
in 1114 A.D. His <i>Siddh&#257;nta-&ccedil;iroma&#7751;i</i> has
enjoyed more authority in India than any other astronomical work except
the <i>S&#363;rya-siddh&#257;nta</i>.</p>

<p class="first">Indian medical science must have begun to develop
before the beginning of our era, for one of its chief authorities,
Charaka, was, according to the Chinese <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

Buddhist <i>Tripi&#7789;aka</i>, the official physician of King
Kanishka in the first century A.D. His work, the
<i>Charaka-sam&#803;hit&#257;</i>, has been edited several times: by J.
Vidy&#257;s&#257;gara, 2nd ed., Calcutta, 1896, by Gupta, Calcutta,
1897, with comm. by C. Dutta, Calcutta, 1892&ndash;1893; trans. by A.
C. Kaviratna, Calcutta, 1897. Su&ccedil;ruta, the next great authority,
seems to have lived not later than the fourth century A.D., as the
Bower MS. (probably fifth century A.D.) contains passages not only
parallel to, but verbally agreeing with, passages in the works of
Charaka and Su&ccedil;ruta. (The
<i>Su&ccedil;ruta-sam&#803;hit&#257;</i>, ed. by J.
Vidy&#257;s&#257;gara, Calcutta, 3rd ed., 1889; A. C. Kaviratna,

Hon. M. A. of Trinity College, Cambridge.</p>
<p><i>ANCIENT GREEK LITERATURE.</i> By <span class="sc">Gilbert
Murray</span>, M. A., Professor of Greek in the University of Glasgow.
12mo. Cloth, $1.50.</p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;A sketch to which the much-abused word
&lsquo;brilliant&rsquo; may be justly applied. Mr. Murray has produced
a book which fairly represents the best conclusions of modern
scholarship with regard to the Greeks.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London
Times.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;An illuminating history of Greek
literature, in which learning is enlivened and supplemented by literary
skill, by a true sense of the &lsquo;humanities.&rsquo; The reader
feels that this is no book of perfunctory erudition, but a labor of
love, performed by a scholar, to whom ancient Greece and her literature
are exceedingly real and vivid. His judgments and suggestions are full
of a personal fresh sincerity; he can discern the living men beneath
their works, and give us his genuine impression of
them.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London Daily Chronicle.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;A fresh and stimulating and delightful
book, and should be put into the hands of all young scholars. It will
make them understand, or help to make them understand, to a degree they
have never yet understood, that the Greek writers over whom they have
toiled at school are living literature after
all.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Westminster Gazette.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;Brilliant and
stimulating.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;A powerful and original
study.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Nation.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;Mr. Murray&rsquo;s style is lucid and
spirited, and, besides the fund of information, he imparts to his
subject such fresh and vivid interest that students will find in these
pages a new impulse for more profound and exhaustive study of this
greatest and most immortal of all the world&rsquo;s
literatures.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Public Ledger.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;The admirable perspective of the whole
work is what one most admires. The reader unlearned in Greek history
and literature sees at once the relation which a given author bore to
his race and his age, and the current trend of thought, as well as what
we value him for to-day.... As an introduction to the study of some
considerable portion of Greek literature in English translations it
will be found of the very highest usefulness.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston
Herald.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;Professor Murray has written an admirable
book, clear in its arrangement, compact in its statements, and is one,
we think, its least scholarly reader must feel an instructive and
thoroughly trustworthy piece of English criticism.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New
York Mail and Express.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;At once scholarly and interesting....
Professor Murray makes the reader acquainted not merely with literary
history and criticism, but with individual living, striving Greeks....
He has felt the power of the best there was in Greek life and
literature, and he rouses the reader&rsquo;s enthusiasm by his own
honest admiration.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston Transcript.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;Professor Murray has contributed a volume
which shows profound scholarship, together with a keen literary
appreciation. It is a book for scholars as well as for the general
reader. The author is saturated with his subject, and has a rare
imaginative sympathy with ancient Greece.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Interior,
Chicago.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;Written in a style that is sometimes
spasmodic, often brilliant, and always fresh and
suggestive.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New York Sun.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;Professor Murray&rsquo;s careful study
will be appreciated as the work of a man of unusual special learning,
combined with much delicacy of literary insight.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New
York Christian Advocate.</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb474" href=
"#pb474" name="pb474">474</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>MODERN ENGLISH LITERATURE.</i> By<br>
<span class="sc">Edmund Gosse</span>, Hon. M. A. of Trinity College,
Cambridge. 12mo. Cloth, $1.50.</p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;Mr. Gosse has been remarkably successful
in bringing into focus and proportion the salient features of this vast
and varied theme. We have read the book, not only with pleasure but
with a singular emotion.... His criticism is generally sympathetic, but
at the same time it is always sober.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London Daily
Chronicle.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;Mr. Gosse&rsquo;s most ambitious book and
probably his best. It bears on every page the traces of a genuine love
for his subject and of a lively critical intelligence. Moreover, it is
extremely readable&mdash;more readable, in fact, than any other single
volume dealing with this same vast subject that we can call to mind....
Really a remarkable performance.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London Times.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;A really useful account of the whole
process of evolution in English letters&mdash;an account based upon a
keen sense at once of the unity of his subject and of the rhythm of its
ebb and flow, and illumined by an unexampled felicity in hitting off
the leading characteristics of individual
writers.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;Probably no living man is more competent
than Mr. Gosse to write a popular and yet scholarly history of English
literature.... The greater part of his life has been given up to the
study and criticism of English literature of the past, and he has a
learned and balanced enthusiasm for every writer who has written
excellently in English.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London Saturday Review.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;The bibliographical list is of extreme
value, as is the bibliographical work generally. It is just one of
these books which every reader will want to place among his working
books.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New York Times.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;To have given in a moderate volume the
main points in a literature almost continuous for five centuries is to
have done a marvelous thing. But he might have done it dryly; he has
made every sentence crisp and sparkling.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Chicago
Times-Herald.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;A book which in soundness of learning,
sanity of judgment, and attractiveness of manner has not been equaled
by the work of any other author who has sought to analyze the elements
of English literature in a concise and authoritative
way.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston Beacon.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;Thoroughly enjoyable from first to last.
It traces the growth of a literature so clearly and simply, that one is
apt to underrate the magnitude of the undertaking. Mr. Gosse&rsquo;s
charming personality pervades it all, and his happy manner illuminates
matter that has been worked over and over until one might imagine all
its freshness gone.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Chicago Evening Post.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;This is not a mere collection of brief
essays on the merits of authors, but a continuous story of the growth
of literature, of which the authors and their works are only incidents.
The book is lucid, readable, and interesting, and a marvel of condensed
information, without its seeming to be so. It can be read by nine out
of ten intelligent people, not only without fatigue, but with pleasure;
and when it is finished the reader will have a comprehensive and
intelligent view of the subject which will not only enable him to talk
with some ease and confidence upon the merits of the principal creators
of English literature, but will also point the way to the right sources
if he wishes to supplement the knowledge which he has derived from this
book.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Pittsburg Times.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;That he has been a careful student,
however, in many departments, the most unrelated and recondite, is
evident on every page, in the orderly arrangement of his multitudinous
materials, in the accuracy of his statements, in the acuteness of his
critical observations, and in the large originality of most of his
verdicts. He says things that many before him may have thought, though
they failed to express them, capturing their fugitive expressions in
his curt, inevitable phrases.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>N. Y. Mail and
Express.</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb475" href="#pb475" name=
"pb475">475</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>FRENCH LITERATURE.</i> By <span class="sc">EDWARD
DOWDEN</span>,<br>
D. Litt., LL. D., D. C. L., Professor of English Literature in the
University of Dublin. 12mo. Cloth, $1.50.</p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;Certainly the best history of French
literature in the English language.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London
Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;This is a history of literature as
histories of literature should be written.... A living voice, speaking
to us with gravity and enthusiasm about the writers of many ages, and
of being a human voice always. Hence this book can be read with
pleasure even by those for whom a history has in itself little
attraction.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London Saturday Review.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;The book is excellently well done;
accurate in facts and dates, just in criticism, well arranged in
method.... The excellent bibliography with which it concludes will be
invaluable to those who wish to pursue the study further on their own
lines.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London Spectator.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;Remarkable for its fullness of information
and frequent brilliancy.... A book which both the student of French
literature and the stranger to it will, in different ways, find
eminently useful, and in many parts of it thoroughly enjoyable as
well.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London Literary World.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;Professor Dowden is both trustworthy and
brilliant; he writes from a full knowledge and a full sympathy. Master
of a style rather correct than charming for its adornments, he can
still enliven his pages with telling epigram and pretty phrase. Above
all things, the book is not eccentric, not unmethodical, not of a
wayward brilliance; and this is especially commendable and fortunate in
the case of an English critic writing upon French
literature.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London Daily Chronicle.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;A book readable, graphic, not overloaded
with detail, not bristling with dates.... It is a book that can be held
in the hand and read aloud with pleasure as a literary treat by an
expert in style, master of charming words that come and go easily, and
of other literatures that serve for illustrations.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The
Critic.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;His methods afford an admirable example of
compressing an immense amount of information and criticism in a
sentence or paragraph, and his survey of a vast field is both
comprehensive and interesting. As an introduction for the student of
literature the work is most excellent, and for the casual reader it
will serve as a compendium of one of the richest literatures of the
world.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Public Ledger.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;Thorough without being diffuse. The author
is in love with his subject, has made it a study for years, and
therefore produced an entertaining volume. Of the scholarship shown it
is needless to speak.... It is more than a cyclop&aelig;dia. It is a
brilliant talk by one who is loaded with the lively ammunition of
French prose and verse. He talks of the pulpit, the stage, the Senate,
and the <i>salon</i>, until the preachers, dramatists, orators, and
philosophers seem to be speaking for themselves.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston
Globe.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;Professor Dowden&rsquo;s book is more
interesting than we ever supposed a brief history of a literature could
be<span class="corr" id="xd21e28008" title="Not in source">.</span> His
characterizations are most admirable in their conciseness and
brilliancy. He has given in one volume a very thorough review of French
literature.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Interior, Chicago.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;The book will be especially valuable to
the student as a safe and intelligible index to a course of
reading.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Independent.</i> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb476" href="#pb476" name="pb476">476</a>]</span></p>
<p>SPANISH LITERATURE.<br>
<span class="sc">By</span> JAMES FITZMAURICE-KELLY,<br>
Member of the Spanish Academy.</p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;Mr. Kelly has written a book that must be
read and pondered, for within its limits it has no rival as &lsquo;A
History of Spanish Literature.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Mail and
Express.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;The work before us is one which no student
can henceforth neglect, ... if the student would keep his knowledge of
Spanish up to date.... We close with a renewed expression of admiration
for this excellent manual; the style is marked and full of piquancy,
the phrases dwell in the memory.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Spectator.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;A handbook that has long been needed for
the use of the general reader, and it admirably supplies the want.
Great skill is shown in the selection of the important facts; the
criticisms, though necessarily brief, are authoritative and to the
point, and the history is gracefully told in sound literary
style.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Saturday Evening Gazette.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;For the first time a survey of Spanish
literature is presented to English readers by a writer of ample
knowledge and keen discrimination. Mr. Kelly&rsquo;s work rises far
beyond the level of the text-books. So good a critic does not merely
comment on literature; he makes it himself.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New York
Bookman.</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb477" href="#pb477" name=

<p>JAPANESE LITERATURE<br>
<span class="sc">By</span> W. G. ASTON, C. M. G., M. A.,<br>
late Acting Secretary at the British Legation at Tokio.</p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;A volume of unique erudition, wide
research, clear discrimination, and excellent design. Mr. Aston has
wrought a memorable service not only to those interested in Japan and
Japanese studies, but to the world of letters at large.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="xd21e28064"><i>Sir Edwin Arnold, in Literature.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;Mr. Aston has written the first complete
narrative from early times to the present of the history, the rituals,
the poetry, the drama, and the personal outpourings of thoughts and
feelings which constitute the body of the literature of
Japan.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="xd21e28064"><i>Baltimore Sun.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;Mr. Aston has unquestionably enabled the
European reader for the first time to enjoy a comprehensive survey of
the vast and ancient field of Japanese literature, of which we have had
hitherto only furtive and partial glimpses.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="xd21e28064"><i>London Times.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;His work is a model of what a manual of
this character should be. While it constitutes an admirable guide-book
to any one who cares to go deeper into this special subject, it is
sufficiently comprehensive to meet the requirements of the average
reader or the general student of literature.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="xd21e28064"><i>Brooklyn Daily Eagle.</i> <span class=

<p>ITALIAN LITERATURE.<br>
<span class="sc">By</span> RICHARD GARNETT, C. B., LL. D.,<br>
Formerly Keeper of Printed Books in the British Museum.</p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;Finished and graceful, at once delicate
and strong, and never relapses into prosiness.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The
Dial.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;Dr. Garnett is lucid in arrangement,
agreeable and correct, and often powerful and felicitous in style. He
has done a real service to both English and Italian
literatures.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Literature.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;The manual is a worthy companion of its
predecessors, and will be found useful by each one who desires to
refresh or enlarge his acquaintance with the magnificent achievements
of Italian genius.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Public Ledger, Philadelphia.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;A most interesting book, written from a
full knowledge of the subject, but without pedantry. The style is
simple, graceful, and readable; the erudition is easily discovered by
those who seek for it, but it is not ostentatiously displayed. Scholars
will appreciate it at its worth; the general reader will be grateful
for the charity of the text, and for the labor that has made his path
one of pleasure only.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Saturday Evening Gazette.</i>

<p>A HISTORY OF BOHEMIAN LITERATURE.<br>
<span class="sc">By</span> FRANCIS, COUNT L&Uuml;TZOW,<br>
Author of &ldquo;Bohemia: An Historical Sketch.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;This book deals with an interesting
subject in an able and impartial manner, and it is written in excellent
English.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London Morning Post.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;Count L&uuml;tzow&rsquo;s wide and deep
knowledge and experience in matters Bohemian have particularly fitted
him for the preparation of this work, and he has succeeded in producing
a highly interesting as well as instructive exposition of a subject
altogether unknown in western Europe, and hardly more familiar in
America.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston Beacon.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;Students of literature will value this
work, because it offers some insight into the character, the extent,
and the quality of Bohemian literature extant, and the general public
will find most interest in the discussion of the life and death of Hus
and the principal events of his career, the life and work of Komensky,
the sketch of Dobrovsky, and the long account of the enthusiastic work
of the four patriots to whom the revival of Bohemian literature in the
present century is due&mdash;Jungmann, Kollar, Safarik, and
Palacky.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston Herald.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;Count L&uuml;tzow&rsquo;s volume is of
special value and interest.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Public

an Introduction by Prof. F. H. Giddings, of Columbia University.<br>
12mo. Cloth, $1.50.</p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;With the spirit of his work it is
impossible to disagree. M. Proal&rsquo;s aim is to show that the
successes of political immorality are fleeting; that principle is
superior to expediency; that audacity is dangerous; that unprincipled
politics are pagan politics, and detrimental to progress of society;
that a return to principles and moral beliefs and the substitution of
ideas for appetites are the true remedy of that hideous
malady&mdash;political corruption.... A careful reading leaves the
reader convinced of the truth of the proposition, that the only
successful policy in the art of government is a moral
policy.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Independent.</i></p>
<p><i>OUR JUVENILE OFFENDERS.</i> By <span class="sc">W. Douglas
Morrison</span>, author of &ldquo;Jews under the Romans,&rdquo;
etc.<br>
12mo. Cloth, $1.50.</p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;An admirable work on one of the most vital
questions of the day.... By scientists, as well as by all others who
are interested in the welfare of humanity, it will be welcomed as a
most valuable and a most timely contribution to the all-important
science of criminology.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New York Herald.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;Of real value to scientific literature. In
its pages humanitarians will find much to arrest their attention and
direct their energies in the interest of those of the young who have
gone astray.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston Daily Globe.</i></p>
<p><i>CRIMINAL SOCIOLOGY.</i> By Prof. <span class="sc">E.
Ferri.</span> 12mo. Cloth, $1.50.</p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;A most valuable book. It is suggestive of
reforms and remedies, it is reasonable and temperate, and it contains a
world of information and well-arranged facts for those interested in or
merely observant of one of the great questions of the
day.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Public Ledger.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;The scientist, the humanitarian, and the
student will find much to indorse and to adopt, while the layman will
wonder why such a book was not written years
ago.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Newark Advertiser.</i></p>
<p><i>THE FEMALE OFFENDER.</i> By Professor <span class=
"sc">Lombroso</span>.<br>
Illustrated. 12mo. Cloth, $1.50.</p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;&lsquo;The Female Offender&rsquo; must be
considered as a very valuable addition to scientific literature.... It
is not alone to the scientist that the work will recommend itself. The
humanitarian, anxious for the reform of the habitual criminal, will
find in its pages many valuable
suggestions.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Item.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;This work will undoubtedly be a valuable
addition to the works on criminology, and may also prove of inestimable
help in the prevention of crime.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Detroit Free
Press.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;The book is a very valuable one, and
admirably adapted for general reading.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston Home
Journal.</i></p>
<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;There is no book of recent issue that
bears such important relation to the great subject of criminology as
this book.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New Haven Leader.</i></p>

<p class="adcitation">&ldquo;He [the author] has written a plain,
straightforward narrative of what he himself saw and learned during his
recent visit to South Africa.... The only criticism of it will be that
